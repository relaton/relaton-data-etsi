  content: This Work Item will study the potential requirements and enhancements to
    the MEC system needed to support MEC Application Slices,i.e., the slicing of the
    MEC applications. The work Item will also study the necessary changes to align
    the MEC support for network slicing studied in MEC024.The content will include
    the concept of MEC application slice, relationship and alignment with MEC system
    support for network slicing, as well as potential requirements and enhancements
    to the MEC system architecture and functions, etc.
