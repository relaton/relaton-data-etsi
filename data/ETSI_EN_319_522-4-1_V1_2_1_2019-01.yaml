abstract:
- content: "Review ETSI EN 319 522-4-1 for taking into account comments raised by
    stakehodlers other than National Standardization Organizations during the ENAP
    process (CEF).\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the EN should be changed as indicated
    below.\r\n\r\nIts clause 5.4 Generic requirements, should:\r\n\r\n1. Make OPTIONAL
    the usage of AS4 compression feature, instead of NOT RECOMMENDING IT, as in version
    1.1.1.\r\n\r\n2. Include the following explanatory note:\r\nWhen using the AS4
    Compression Feature as defined in section 3.1 of the AS4 Profile [4] the user
    contents would be compressed prior to being signed and therefore the signature
    would not apply to the original user content. As it might be relevant for certain
    services to have the original data signed rather than the compressed data, whether
    the AS4 Compression Feature or HTTP compression is left to a specific agreement
    or registration in the common service infrastructures."
