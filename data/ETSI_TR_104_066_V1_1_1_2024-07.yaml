abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this work item is to identify methods and techniques that
    are appropriate for security testing of AI-based components including to show
    that the requirements for explicability and transparency are met by the test objectives.
    Security testing of AI has some commonalities with security testing of traditional
    systems but provides new challenges and requires different approaches, due to
    (a) significant differences between subsymbolic AI and traditional systems that
    have strong implications on their security and on how to test their security properties,
    (b) non-determinism since AI-based systems may evolve over time (self-learning
    systems) and security properties may degrade, (c) test oracle problem, assigning
    a test verdict is different and more difficult for AI-based systems since not
    all expected results are known a priori, and (d) data-driven algorithms: in contrast
    to traditional systems, (training) data forms the behaviour of subsymbolic AI.\r\nThe
    scope of this work item is to cover the following topics:\r\n• security testing
    approaches for AI\r\n• security test oracles for AI\r\n• definition of test adequacy
    criteria for security testing of AI.\r\n"
