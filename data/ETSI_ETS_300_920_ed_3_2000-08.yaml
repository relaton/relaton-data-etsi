abstract:
- content: "Bearer and Teleservices, as respectively defined in GSM 02.02 and GSM\r\n02.03,
    are the objects which the GSM PLMN operators offer to their cus\r\ntomers. Besides
    these basic telecommunications services, features whic\r\nh aim at up grading
    these basic services need also to be offered. Due\r\nto the use of radiocommunications
    in a PLMN, which are of a special na\r\nture compared to classical distribution
    transmission techniques used i\r\nn the fixed networks, such a category of features
    is related to securi\r\nty aspects.\r\nIn a GSM PLMN, both the users and the network
    operator have to be prot\r\nected against undesirable intrusion of third parties.
    However, measure\r\ns should be provided for in order to insure maximum protection
    of the\r\nrights of the individuals concerns. As a consequence, a security featu\r\nre
    is either a supplementary service to Tele or Bearer services, which\r\ncan be
    selected by the subscriber, or a network function involved in\r\nthe provision
    of one or several telecommunication services.\r\nThe purpose of this European
    Telecommunication Standard (ETS) is to de\r\nfine the security features which
    are to be available in a GSM PLMN, to\r\ngether with the associated levels of
    protection. This ETS is only conc\r\nerned with those security features which
    aim at the up grading of the\r\nsecurity in a GSM PLMN. In particular, end to
    end security is outside\r\nthe scope of this ETS.\r\nThe implementation aspects
    of security features are described in GSM 0\r\n3.20.\r\n "
