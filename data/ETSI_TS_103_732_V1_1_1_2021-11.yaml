  content: "The intention of this work item is to deliver a set of security and evaluation
    requirements to be used in consumer mobile devices security assessment. Increasing
    services and features on consumer mobile devices make them more attractive for
    attackers.  It is necessary to identify key assets on the consumer mobile devices
    to be protected and the main security threats to these key assets in consumer
    scenario. The specification will also define security objectives, that when fulfilled,
    the security threats could be dramatically decreased. Security functions should
    be implemented by the consumer mobile device, in order to protect key assets,
    address the security threats and fulfill the security objectives. The requirements
    for these security functions will also be defined in the specification. At last,
    security assurance requirements are needed for testing and assessment of mobile
    device security.  \r\n\r\nThe work item will take provisions in TS 103 645 / EN
    303 645 which are applicable to consumer mobile devices as high level guidance
    and will define detailed security requirements following those provisions. In
    addition, this work item will also define requirements which are not covered by
    TS 103 645 / EN 303 645. \r\n\r\nRadio aspects as well as features specific to
    some network technologies (e.g. use of UICC in 3GPP) are excluded from the scope
    of this WI.\r\n\r\nSimilar works in other SDOs (e.g. ISO/IEC JTC1 SC17, GSMA)
    will be considered to ensure consistency. \r\n\r\nThe specification should be
    structured as following: \r\nToE definition and usage; Security threats (e.g.
    network eavesdropping, physical assess, flawed applications); Security objectives
    (e.g. protected communications, protected storage, mobile device integrity, end
    user privacy); Security functional requirements (e.g. TLS support, key management,
    data anonymization, authentication, application isolation, secure boot); Security
    assurance requirement (e.g. guidance documentation, lifecycle support, independent
    testing); Additional information, optional requirements, use cases, etc.  \r\n\r\nThis
    document is intended for consumer mobile device manufacturer, implementing those
    best practices recommendations, and as a guideline for 3rd parties, looking to
    assess the security functions on mobile consumer devices, e.g. evaluators. \r\n\r\nIn
    the context of this work item the term consumer mobile device refers to a class
    of devices with mobile connectivity capabilities, high computation power and rich
    user interface such as smartphones or tablets used for personal purpose by the
    individual owner."
