abstract:
- content: "The purpose and scope of this work item is to describe possible startegies
    for the evolution of fixed networks towards UMTS, with the aim to produce protocol
    requirements for other ETSI groups. The following issues should be covered by
    this work iitem:\r\n- Identification of evolutions scenarios;\r\n- Migration of
    the transport platform: Definition of networks/network components that need to
    be upgraded with UMTS capabilities, Interworking with legacy networks/network
    components. Signalling methods to be used in the evolving networks to ensure such
    interworking. Identification of requirements on transport technologies such as
    ATM and IP.\r\n- Introduction of wireless access networks in the fixed network.
    Interconnection of wireless access networks as specified by e.g. SMG2 and EP BRAN
    with fixed network evolved UMTS (e.g., ISDN, PSTN, IP, ATM).\r\n- Introduction
    of mobility-supporting capabilities in fixed networks. Options for implementing
    mobility in fixed network evolved UMTS (modified MAP, IN-based, mobile ATM).\r\n\r\nReference
