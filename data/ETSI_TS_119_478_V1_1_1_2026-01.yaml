abstract:
- content: Article 45e of the eIDAS-regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 obliges the EU Member
    States to ensure until the end of 2026, that qualified trust service providers
    are able to verify at least the attributes listed Annex VI of the regulation at
    the request of the user. The new work item aims at specifying the interface for
    this purpose. Furthermore, the new work item also aims at specifying a second
    interface, which allows to retrieve additional attributes of the user upon request,
    if supported by the authentic source. The present new work item aims at specifying
    the necessary technical framework for the required access of the involved Authentic
    Sources, which includes architectures, components, interfaces, protocols, data
    structures and related security considerations.
