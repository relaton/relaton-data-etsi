- content: "TThe purpose of this third edition European Telecommunication Standard\r\n(ETS)
    is to present the possible architectures of the mobile system.\r\nClause 3 of
    this ETS contains a definition of the different functional\r\nentities needed
    to support the mobile service. In clause 4, the confi\r\nguration of a PLMN is
    described as well as the organization of the fun\r\nctional entities; the configuration
    presented is the most general in o\r\nrder to cope with all the possible implementations
    which can be imagin\r\ned in the different countries. To illustrate that purpose,
    some exampl\r\nes of possible configurations are presented. Clause 5 of this ETS
    cont\r\nains a brief description of the interfaces involved which shows the pr\r\ninciple
    of the organization considered.\r\n "
