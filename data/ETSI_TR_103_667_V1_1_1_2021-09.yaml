abstract:
- content: To propose an overall framework based on combinations of co-channel and/or
    non-co-channel operation, as presented to CEPT, to address spectrum sharing between
    ITS-G5 and LTE-V2X ITS technologies enabling both technologies to use the same
    spectrum in the same geographical area. The overall framework may consist of several
    options for such combined operation.
