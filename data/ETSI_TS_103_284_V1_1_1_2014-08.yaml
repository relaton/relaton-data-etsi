abstract:
- content: "The aim of the present work item is to establish a formal categorization
    of ECCS systems based on :\r\n- communication capabilities,\r\n- environmental
    robustness, \r\n- mobility (on the move, on the pause, on the stop),\r\n- energy
    consumption and \r\n- physical characteristics.\r\nThe present work should assist
    the various stakeholders in the procurement of communications systems with ECCS
    capabilities by providing them with a formal framework for expressing their requirements. "
