abstract:
- content: "The wireless terminal location registration supplementary service (SS-WTLR)
    enables a WTM user to register at, or de-register from, the current location within
    the PISN. The ability to register at different locations in the PISN at different
    times enables the WPM user to maintain the provided services (including the ability
    to make and receive calls) at different access points. Deregistration is used
    to inform the PISN that the WPM user is temporarily unable to make use of the
    provided services (including the receipt of incoming calls).\r\nThe information
    exchange Additional Network Feature (ANF-WTINFO) allows to exchange information
    about a WTLR user between the Home Data Base and the Visitor Data Base."
