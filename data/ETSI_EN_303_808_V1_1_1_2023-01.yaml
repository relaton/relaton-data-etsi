abstract:
- content: The standard will define an assessment of the direct applicability of eight
    general material efficiency standards to ICT network infrastructure goods in the
    context of circular economy. The existing generic standards address ability to
    remanufacture, repair, reuse, and upgrade; and recyclability and recoverability  ,
    and assess recycled content and  reused components, critical raw material and
    information provision. The present standard will determine if further metrics/KPI
    and measurement methodologies are necessary for ICT network infrastructure goods
    beyond each of the eight general standards.
