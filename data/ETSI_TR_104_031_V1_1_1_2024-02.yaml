abstract:
- content: 'This work item covers security aspects of pervasive and collaborative
    artificial intelligence (AI) (e.g., federated learning, transfer learning, distributed
    reinforcement learning, decentralized machine learning), where multiple AI agents
    are pervasively distributed in different places but interact with each other to
    work on the same or different AI tasks. These AI agents exchange AI models and/or
    inferred knowledge. The work item investigates use cases of security for pervasive
    and collaborative AI, and analyzes potential security concerns such as trust and
    communications among those AI agents. Then the work item provides technical recommendations
    on approaches to mitigate these issues including their limitations.  '
