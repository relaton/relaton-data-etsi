abstract:
- content: "-Speech quality performance in the presence of background noise reduction
    algorithms\r\n-Sound field simulation when directional microphones are used\r\n-The
    application area is hands-free terminals, mobile terminals, networks and car audio
    systems. \r\nThis revision provides an update to the test room requirements and
    recommendations, and aims to achieve backwards compatibility with previous revisions
    while keeping the language concise. This revision allows to keep the acoustic
    conditions optimal even in smaller rooms. It also provides a practical benefit
    of reducing the system calibration complexity."
