- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "Study fixed-mobile convergence scenario's in order to derive requirements
    and capabilities to support FMC capabilities (e.g. network attachment, roaming,
    etc.) and the impact of multimedia communication services (e.g. telephony, sms,
    mms, etc.). Determine the responsible body for each requirement/capability and
    the release in which it is (to be) covered. \r\nThe goal is: \r\n- to identify
    specific access types, and which organisation is defining each of them\r\n- to
    determine requirements and capabilities (taking account of terminal requirements)
    and to analyse these to determine which are:\r\nwithin TISPAN's scope\r\nbeing
    progressed within other bodies\r\na priority for TISPAN Release 2\r\nincluded
    in the next release of 3GPP."
