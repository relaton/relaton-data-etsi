abstract:
- content: "Asynchronous Contact Tracing (ACT) traces the IoT connected object that
    may have been infected by the Covid-19 virus (or future pandemic viruses).\r\nThis
    shifts the paradigm, from searching for a person in the process of infecting another
    to the tracing of both potential contamination and infections, and leveraging
    on the combination of the two information.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this WI is to standardize
    the full support of Asynchronous Contact Tracing (ACT) by means of\r\n1) providing
    some examples of use and deployment of ACT by means of a few explanatory use cases.\r\n2)
    specifying the ACT method and its interaction with deployed contact tracing applications
    for human and systems. This includes the interaction with the different technologies
    used by non ACT contact tracing solutions.\r\n3) specifying the ACT system including
    application protocols and API.\r\n\r\nThe new ACT method will require the use
    of existing ready-to-market IoT-based technology and well-established wireless
    network techniques, in particular the ones specified in the ETSI standards ecosystem.\r\nMoreover,
    it will preserve the user's privacy in accordance with GDPR and/or other regional
    requirements not requiring the transmission of any personal information by the
    user.  "
