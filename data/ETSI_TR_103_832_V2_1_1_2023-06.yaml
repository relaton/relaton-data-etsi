  content: "Study and development of the required (potential) ITS support/enhancements
    for Pre-Crash based applications including:\r\n\tDefinition and description of
    the relevant Pre-Crash use cases \r\n\tDefinition of the Pre-Crash potential Requirements
    \r\n\tDevelopment and evaluation of supporting/required ITS enhancements: \r\no\tUsage
    and extensions of existing messages types or services such as e.g. DENM.\r\nFinal
    goal of this work will be to provide text and ASN.1 code proposals for the implementation
    of the required enhancements for Pre-Crash functions for relevant specifications
    (such as) e.g.\r\n-\tApplications and facilities layer common data dictionary\r\n-\tSpecifications
    of Decentralized Environmental Notification Basic Service"
