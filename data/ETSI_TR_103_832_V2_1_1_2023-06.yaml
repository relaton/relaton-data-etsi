- content: "Study and development of the required (potential) ITS support/enhancements
    for Pre-Crash based applications including:\r\n•\tDefinition and description of
    the relevant Pre-Crash use cases \r\n•\tDefinition of the Pre-Crash potential
    Requirements \r\n•\tDevelopment and evaluation of supporting/required ITS enhancements:
    \r\no\tUsage and extensions of existing messages types or services such as e.g.
    DENM.\r\nFinal goal of this work will be to provide text and ASN.1 code proposals
    for the implementation of the required enhancements for Pre-Crash functions for
    relevant specifications (such as) e.g.\r\n-\tApplications and facilities layer
    common data dictionary\r\n-\tSpecifications of Decentralized Environmental Notification
