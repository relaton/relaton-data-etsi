abstract:
- content: "To identify and apportion the transmission signal delay accross public\r\nswitched
    networks from user-network interface to user-network\r\nnetwork interface. This
    will enable guidlines to be established\r\nfor planning complex digital transport
    systems in the access and core\r\nnetworks to be identified, without the additional
    for echo\r\ncancellation devices.\r\n"
