  content: The work item will study criteria for evaluating the reliability for cloud-native
    (as defined in EVE011) VNFs. Starting from use case investigation of some management
    processes (e.g., upgrade), it will identify the metrics associated with the reliability
    criteria for VNFs and analyse their support by NFV-MANO for the evaluation of
    VNFs reliability. The outcome will include recommendations on requirements for
    such criteria and their associated metrics to be supported by NFV-MANO for cloud-native
    VNFs; and proposals for the following normative work. The resulting deliverable
    will be informative.
