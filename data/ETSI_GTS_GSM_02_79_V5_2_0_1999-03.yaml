  content: "This Stage 1 is a description of the first phase of Support of Optimal\r\nRouting
    (SOR):\r\n-\tcompiles the basic service requirements for SOR;\r\n-\tdescribes
    the interactions for Supplementary Services (SS) in order\r\nto cater for SOR;\r\n-\trefers
    to modifications to network features required by SOR.\r\nThis Global System for
    Mobile communications Technical Specification (\r\nGTS) does not address the following:\r\n-\tThere
    is no need for optimization of the routing of calls originally\r\ndirected to
    a fixed network subscriber, because the physical address\r\nof a fixed network
    terminating line cannot differ from its logical add\r\nress.\r\n -\tSOR in non-GSM
    mobile networks is not a subject of this GTS, but mig\r\nht be possible by bilateral
    arrangement between GSM network operators\r\nand those non-GSM mobile network
    operators.\r\n The purpose of SOR is to reduce the number of unnecessary inter-PLMN
    c\r\nall legs.\r\nThe first phase of SOR applies to:\r\n-\tOR performed within
    a country (i.e. Mobile to mobile calls where bot\r\nh mobile subscribers are located
    in the same country);\r\n -\tOR performed towards the country where the call would
    have normally\r\nbeen routed without OR (e.g. Conditional Call Forwarding towards
    the H\r\nome Country of the called party).\r\n The complete set of scenarios included
    in the phase 1 of OR is present\r\ned in the paragraph for normal procedures.
    All other scenarios are exc\r\nluded from Phase 1 of OR.\r\nNote that Optimal
    Routing is applicable to national roaming situations\r\n, that is to calls directed
    to a mobile subscriber roaming in her home\r\ncountry, but registered in a PLMN
    different from her HPLMN.\r\nAll further call scenarios, including multiple call
    forwarding, are le\r\nft to subsequent phases of SOR. Subsequent phases of SOR
    shall be back\r\nwards compatible with this first phasd.\r\n "
