abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-TST 008 conducts NFV Release 3 maintenance. It corrects
    errors, ambiguities, misalignments, and applies editorial modifications (i.e.
    Corrections of category F and D as described in ETSI TWPs Annex L). This edition
    does not add or modify features, nor does it extend the scope of the former Release
    3 edition summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-TST 008 specifies detailed and vendor-agnostic
    key operational performance metrics at different layers of the NFVI, especially
    processor usage and network interface usage metrics. These metrics are expected
    to serve as references for processed and time-aggregated measurement values for
    performance management information that traverses the Or-Vi and/or Vi-Vnfm reference
    points of the NFV architectural framework. The present document contains normative
    provisions."
