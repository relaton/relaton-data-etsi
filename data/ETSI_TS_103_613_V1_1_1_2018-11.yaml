abstract:
- content: "To define the physical layer and the data link layer and radio resource
    configuration, grouped into the access layer of the ITS station reference architecture
    EN 302 665. The access layer technology that is specified in the present document
    refers to what is known as the sidelink or PC5 interface of LTE Vehicle to everything
    (LTE-V2X) for the following frequency bands:\r\n \r\n•\tOperation in frequency
    band dedicated to ITS for safety related applications in the frequency range 5,875
    GHz to 5,925 GHz.\r\n•\tOperation in frequency bands dedicated to ITS non-safety
    applications in the frequency range 5,855 GHz to 5,875 GHz.\r\n \r\nThe LTE-V2X
    technology is based on 3GPP specifications.\r\n"
