  content: "This revision of NFV-SOL 014 provides bug fixes and other improvements
    as a Release 4 maintenance version of the document, starting with NFVSOL(23)000392.
    The scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-SOL 014 specifies
    a set of YAML-based data models for descriptor-based virtualised resource management
    fulfilling the requirements concerning the input and output information exchanged
    over the virtualised resource management interfaces specified in the ETSI GS NFV-IFA
    005, and the ETSI GS NFV-IFA 006. NFV-SOL 014 focuses on data models used in the
    virtualised resource descriptors for the Virtualised Compute interfaces, Virtualised
    Network interfaces and Virtualised Storage interfaces, which are used to perform
    orchestration and lifecycle management for consumable virtualised resources comprised
    of compute, network and storage. NFV-SOL 014 also focuses on data models used
    in the virtualised resource descriptors for the Virtualised Resources Change Notification
    interfaces and Virtualised Resources Fault Management interfaces. Other virtualised
    resource management interfaces, as well as data models for information specified
    in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 and ETSI GS NFV-IFA 014, are out of the scope of NFV-SOL
    014."
