- content: 'Part of a series of standards for combined and/or integrated radio and
    non-radio equipment (EN 303 466-2), where part 1 for household appliances is currently
    developed under ERM-EMC-348. This part of the standard sets requirements for radio
    enabled products designed for and intendend to be used in industrial locations
    in respect of ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) under article 3.1(b) of Directive
    2014/53/EU. This standard, together with ?the relevant CENELEC EMC product, product
    family or generic standard(s) for similar non radio-enabled products designed
    for and intendend to be used in industrial locations; plus ?ETSI EN 301 489-1
    and ?the relevant parts of the ETSI EN 301 489-series for the specific radio technologies
    deployed specifies the applicable test conditions, performance assessment and
    performance criteria for radio enabled products designed for and intendend to
    be used in industrial locations . Technical specifications related to the antenna
    port of the equipment are not included in this standard. Such technical specifications
    are found in the relevant product standards for the effective use of the radio
    spectrum. The environmental classification and the emission and immunity requirements
    used in this standard are as stated in the relevant CENELEC EMC standard for similar
    non radio-enabled products, except for any special conditions included in this
    standard. The content and conclusions of the newly developed EG 203 367 will be
    taken into account during the development of this standard. Products within the
    scope of this standard are those falling under the scope of: 1.EN 50270:2015-01Electromagnetic
    compatibility. Electrical apparatus for the detection and measurement of combustible
    gases, toxic gases or oxygen. 2.EN 55011:2009-11Industrial, scientific and medical
    equipment. Radio-frequency disturbance characteristics. Limits and methods of
    measurement. 3.EN 55011/A1:2010-07Industrial, scientific and medical equipment.
