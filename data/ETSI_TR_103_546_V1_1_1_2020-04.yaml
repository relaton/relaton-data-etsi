  content: "To facilitate the potential preparation of a standard for Smart Lifts
    \ collecting and developing  type and range of data which might be exchanged between
    lifts and their relevant management applications. It also includes information
    about  the monitoring of the activities and the performance of such lifts, including
    the possible interaction with the rest of the IoT devices and applications.\r\nThe
    information analyzed  include:\r\n- the combination of the data exchanged and
    the possible widening of the current types and range,\r\n- the current means,
    protocols  and platforms applied for such exchange of information,\r\n- the generally
    applied  levels of access authorization,   \r\n- the means of data analyzing,
    formatting and storage, \r\n- the other possible users for some of the available
    information currently collected."
