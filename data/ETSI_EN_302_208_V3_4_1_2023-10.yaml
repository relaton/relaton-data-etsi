abstract:
- content: "Scope of work to be undertaken: To clarify the following matters:  \r\n1.
    The harmonised standard uses vague terms in different parts. In particular in
    \r\na. Note 1 of the scope: “The term frequency band is typically used for reference
    to dedicated bands as described in CEPT/ERC/REC 70-03 [i.9], while frequency range
    is used in the other cases.” \r\nb. Table 1b: “Category I is a high performance
    level of interrogator, typically used where the distance between the RFID interrogator
    and RFID tags is often greater than 10 m or in challenging RF propagation environments;
    e.g. large quantity of RFID tags in close proximity to each other or mounted on
    metals, liquids, etc. An example of an interrogator in this performance class
    is a fixed mounted interrogator situated at a dock door of a warehouse or manufacturing
    facility.” \r\nc. Table 1b: “Category II is a performance level of interrogator,
    typically used for general purpose applications and where the distance between
    the RFID interrogator and RFID tags is typically lower than for category I. An
    example of an interrogator in this performance class is a handheld interrogator
    used in a retail store.” \r\nd. Table 1b: “Category III is a performance level
    of interrogator, typically used for very short range application where the distance
    between the RFID interrogator and RFID tags is significantly lower than for category
    I or the RF integrator power is confined to a small area. An example of an interrogator
    in this performance class is an RFID tag printer or nearly contact reader.” \r\ne.
    Clause 5.5.7.1: “A small quantity of tags (typically up to 3) shall be positioned
    within the interrogation field of the interrogator.”  These terms are all subjective
    and can give room to very diverse interpretations.  They can affect the tests
    or the categorisation, hence the requested performance, of the equipment. \r\n2.
    In Table 2, one band in the first column is not aligned to REC 74-01, which requires
    increased protection until 694 MHz, not 692 MHz.  3. To align the new revision
    with ERC REC 74-01.\r\n3. Figure 8 in the published standard I not as in the approved
    document from ERM and ERM TG34 and in particular does not consider the new Table
    2 changes due to REC 74-01 as above.\r\n"
