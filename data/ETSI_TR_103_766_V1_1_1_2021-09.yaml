abstract:
- content: "To carry out studies on the feasibility of co-channel co-existence between
    ITS-G5 and LTE-V2X technologies based on solutions presented to CEPT.\r\nTo define
    methodologies and metrics required for performing the studies and evaluating the
    performance of the solutions studied.\r\nTo find co-channel co-existence methods
    which enable both technologies to use the same frequency channel in the same geographical
    area while meeting the metrics defined.\r\nThis TR shall classify co-channel co-existence
    methods depending on the observed metrics."
