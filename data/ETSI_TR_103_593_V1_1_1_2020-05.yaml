    recommendation M.2057 and ITU-R report M.2322) on automotive radar (AI.1.18).
    The current regulation should be reviewed in the light of the results of WRC15.
    \r\nThe document will include necessary information to support the co-operation
    between ETSI and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European
    Conference of Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), including: •
    Detailed market information (annex A); • Technical information (annex B); • Relation
    to existing spectrum regulation (annex C); • Expected compatibility issues (annex
