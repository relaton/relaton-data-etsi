abstract:
- content: "\tThis proposed work item can determine requirements to represent digital
    technology products, either models, batches or even individual ICT goods. These
    details are intended to be represented in digital format. The details can represent
    products at the time of manufacturing, including relevant information for product
    transparency and a circular lifecycle, such as details related to origin of materials
    composition, design, manufacturing, energy consumption, maintenance, repair, preparation
    for reuse, final recycling, and may include links to related documentation. The
    work may consider to include or relate to details that change over the lifespan
    of a product as a result of events including repair, upgrade, usage, sale, and
    final recycling. The details should exclude any personal or business sensitive
    information. It can allow not only to facilitate and automate comparison of different
    ICT products based on attributes, with a focus on circularity aspects, but also
    can facilitate preparation and reuse in the second-hand market and the reverse
    supply chain, facilitate the exchange and aggregation of data records about models
    and devices, more accountable recycling and e-waste management, help determine
    statistics about actual durability and reusability from aggregated contributed
    data from events in a circular lifespan. It can help manufacturers, governments,
    users to implement voluntary reporting and monitoring mechanisms to assess these
    qualities, and become an incentive to design and use more circular ICT devices.
    The goal of the standards is to define the semantics (recommended items and potential
    values) required to represent the relevant information, and relate to existing
    known digital data formats, linked data, and system architectures, as well as
    relate and complement upcoming regional (e.g. European digital product passport)
    and global (ISO PCDS, IEC 82474-1) standards. This standards takes in special
    consideration ICT products classified according to the ITU-T L.1023 recommendation
    on an assessment method for circular scoring, by facilitating the collection of
    data that can show the effect of design decision in practice. It can help collect
    details as data records along the lifespan of ICT devices to assess and report
    impacts of circular business models as in ITU-T L.1024, about selling services
    instead of equipment on waste creation and the environment. It can facilitate
    the calculation of environmental impacts of different ICT devices according to
    ITU-T L.1400-1451, and mobile phones according to ITU-T L.1015. This will be a
    technically aligned deliverables with ITU-T SG5"
