  content: "This work item provides a framework to configure oneM2M AEs and CSEs in
    the Field Domain by the oneM2M SP. \r\nThe configuration information may include:\r\nThe
    availability of protocol bindings\r\nThe URI of registrar CSE that  receives Registration
    requests.\r\nThe URI of registrar CSE that receives non-Registration requests.\r\nThe
    address of target resource to use a oneM2M Service. [e.g. reconfigurable to add/delete
    service during operation]\r\nThe credential data that is required for accessing
    the resource. [e.g. reconfigurable to grant/revoke authorization]\r\nAs the result
    of consideration in stage 2 work, it is needed to develop a Technical Specification
    to solve existing problem in Release-1 specifications which only supports pre-provitioning
    for configuring the filed-domain devices. \r\nThe security aspects for remote
    provisioning should be discussed in WG4.\r\n"
