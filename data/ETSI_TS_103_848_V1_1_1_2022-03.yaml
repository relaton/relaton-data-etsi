abstract:
- content: 'This work item will specify normative and testable security provisions
    for Home Gateways, across the complete lifecycle from development to decommission
    and subsequent end-of-life. The security provisions address all aspects of the
    device architecture in terms of hardware, software, interfaces and data. Based
    on the analysis drawn in TR/CYBER-0056 (Home Gateway security threat and mitigation
    analysis), the TS will build on EN 303 645 (Cyber Security for Consumer Internet
    of Things: Baseline Requirements).'
