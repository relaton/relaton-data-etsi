  content: "The Scope of this GTS is to clarify how interworking can\r\nbe obtained
    between phase 2 mobile stations and phase 1\r\ninfrastructure.  The objective
    is to obtain this without changing the\r\nconsolidated set of phase 1 specifications.
    This Technical Report\r\nspecifies the necessary amendments to the phase 1 infrastructure
    so\r\nthat an acceptable service is offered to mobile stations of phase 2,\r\nguaranteeing
    that a phase 2 mobile station obtains all phase 1\r\nservices.\r\n This report
    outlines the necessary changes as well as the necessary\r\ncontrols and clarifications
    \ with regard to phase 1 implementation,\r\nwhich should be performed to the different
    interfaces in phase 1\r\ninfrastructure before phase 2 mobiles are offered service.\r\n
