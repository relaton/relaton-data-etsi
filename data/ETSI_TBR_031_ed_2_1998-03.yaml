abstract:
- content: "This Technical Basis for Regulation (TBR) specifies the technical requ\r\nirements
    to be met by terminal equipment capable of connecting to a pu\r\nblic telecommunications
    network. These requirements apply to terminals\r\nfor Phase 2 of the public land
    mobile radio service, operating in\r\n-\tthe DCS 1 800 band; or\r\n-\tboth in
    the DCS 1 800 band and the GSM 900 MHz band.\r\nwith a channel separation of 200
    kHz, utilizing constant envelope modu\r\nlation and carrying traffic channels
    according to the Time Division Mu\r\nltiple Access (TDMA) principle.\r\nThis TBR
    specifies the access requirements for terminals as stated abo\r\nve implementing
    the GSM standard.\r\nFor each test purpose and its corresponding conformance requirement,
    a\r\nreference is given to the test method in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1)\r\n[2].
    The requirements apply at the air interface and the Subscriber Id\r\nentity Module
    - Mobile Equipment interface for the access requirements\r\n, which may be stimulated
    to perform the tests by additional equipment\r\nif necessary.\r\nThe measurement
    uncertainty is described in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1\r\n) [2].\r\nThis TBR covers
    the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive 9\r\n1/263/EEC [1] Articles
    4d, 4e, 4f. Non access related aspects of speec\r\nh telephony, where Article
    4g has been applied, are covered by TBR 32.\r\nThe Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC
    [1] Articles 4a and 4b are covered b\r\ny other directives, and, therefore, not
    by this TBR.\r\nIn this TBR, there are no Electromagnetic Compatibility technical
    requ\r\nirements in terms of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1], Article 4c\r\n.\r\nNOTE:\tTechnical
    Requirements for EMC performance and testing of the eq\r\nuipment are covered
    by the relevant standards applicable to the EMC Di\r\nrective 89/336/EEC, annex
    A.\r\nTerminal equipment may be subject Co additional requirements in other\r\nCommon
    Technical Regulations (CTR) depending on the equipments functio\r\nnality.\r\nETS
    300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2] constitutes the conformance test suite\r\nreferenced
    by this TBR. The verification of the conformance requireme\r\nnts in this TBR
    is based on the tests described in this reference. The\r\nset of requirements
    in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2] and the set of\r\nrequirements in this TBR
    need not be identical.\r\nSome requirements only apply to specific types of mobile
    station (e.g.\r\ndata tests only apply to mobile stations with a data facility).
    The T\r\nBR also indicates the specific test which should be carried out for ea\r\nch
    mobile station type.\r\nAn active accessory is covered by this TBR if it modifies
    the terminal\r\nperformance in an aspect which affects conformance to essential
    requi\r\nrements.\r\nNOTE:\tOnly active devices are subject to this TBR. Accessories
    may be\r\ntested with specific terminals, and either approved for use with those\r\nterminals
    only, or may possibly be approved for use with a wider rang\r\ne of terminals,
    depending on the nature and effect of the accessory.\r\n "
