abstract:
- content: "Baseline System for a Digital multi-programme Television by Cable\r\n(DTVC).
    Harmonized transmission standard for cable and satellite,\r\nbased on the MPEG-2
    System Layer, with the addition of Forward Error\r\nCorrection (FEC) technique.
    It is compatible with the modulation/\r\nchannel coding system used for digital
    multi-programme television by\r\nsatellite (DE/JTC-DVB-6).\r\nThe System allows
    for further evolution as technology advances and is\r\ncapable of starting a reliable
    service as of now. The Baseline System\r\nis based on QAM modulation scheme. It
    allows for 16, 32 or 64-QAM\r\nconstellations and permits future extension to
    higher constellation\r\nsuch as 128 and 256-QAM.\r\n "
