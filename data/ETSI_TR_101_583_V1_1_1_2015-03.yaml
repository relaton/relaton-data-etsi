  content: "This Technical Specification defines terminology and an ontology which,
    together, provide the basis for a common understanding of security testing techniques
    which can be to be used in testing communication products and systems. The terminology
    and ontology have been derived from current standards and best practices specified
    by a broad range of standards organizations and industry bodies and offers guidance
    to practitioners on testing and assessment of security, robustness and resilience
    throughout the product and systems development lifecycle. This document specifies
    terms and methods for the following security testing approaches:\r\n\r\nVerification
    of security functions;\r\nLoad and performance testing;\r\nResilience and robustness
    testing (fuzzing).\r\n"
