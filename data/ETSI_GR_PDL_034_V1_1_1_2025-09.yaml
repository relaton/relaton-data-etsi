abstract:
- content: International Data Space Association has a reference architecture for data
    space. This Work Item analyses the architecture and key functionalities of a novel
    Trustworthy Data Space (TDS), designed to serve as a secure, efficient, and interoperable
    infrastructure for data circulation and utilization. The study also investigates
    opportunities integrating PDL in Data Space. Making the reference architecture
    more secure and accessible with trustworthiness.
