abstract:
- content: "This Technical Specification (TS) specifies the procedures used at the\r\nradio
    interface (Reference Point Um, see GSM TS 04.02) for Call\r\nControl (CC), Mobility
    Management (MM) and Radio Resource (RR)\r\nmanagement.\r\nWhen the notations for
    \"further study\" or \"FS\" or \"FFS\" are present in\r\nthis document they mean
    that the indicated text is not a normative\r\nportion of this standard.\r\nThese
    procedures are defined in terms of messages exchanged over the\r\ncontrol channels
    of the radio interface. The control channels are\r\ndescribed in TS GSM 04.03.\r\nThe
    structured functions and procedures of this protocol and the\r\nrelationship with
    other layers and entities are described in general\r\nterms in TS GSM 04.07.\r\n
