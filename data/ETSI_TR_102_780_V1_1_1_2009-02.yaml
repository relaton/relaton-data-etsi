  content: "To provide a Technical Report giving a guide to the availability and use
    of security methods documents from ETSI. In addition the report should identify
    those documents that are primarily generic that could become wholly generic guidance
    with some editing (technical as well as purely editorial). In many cases there
    is unnecessary duplication of material across TBs as there is no generic guidance
    to reference. The guide has to identify where duplicate material exists such that
    future work can be done to rationalise the duplication and give a concise and
    complete set of security standard development guidance documents\r\nInput  to
    be integrated to style of MTS MBS and other guidance documents."
