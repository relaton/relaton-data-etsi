abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this work item is to identify and describe the emerging
    IPv6 based use cases and scenarios: IPv6 evolution in Data Centers, Network and
    Cloud Integration\r\n.In this case,IPv6 can be envisaged to be used to meet the
    following requirements.\r\n-\tIPv6 evolution in Data Centers where the cloud resides,\r\n-\tInter-connection
    of clouds\r\n-\tIPv6-based virtual private cloud planning\r\n-\tAddressing of
    the virtual machines in the cloud and inter-working with global Internet\r\n-\tNew
    services or functions, such as SFC (service function chain) and SD-WAN.\r\nIt
    should be noted that the use case mentioned here is independent to wireless and
    wireline network.\r\n"
