  content: "This WI covers the standardization of an IP based VRS interface, to be
    used for a railway telecommunications system evolving to packet (IP) switched
    technologies.\r\nThe definition of VRS is out of scope of this activity, however
    specification of the content of the messages exchanged on the newly defined interface
    will cope with any future IP based VRS implementation.\r\n"
