  content: 'This work will propose a way to produce security events and to test the
    effectiveness of existing detection means. Scenario catalogues will give inspiration
    for test/monitoring objectives and allow faster implementation. Examples of frequent
    security test pattern will be used to illustrate some powerful means and methods
    of event testing. The definition and use of a test (pattern) catalog for test
    implementation allows: introduction of dedicated sets (levels), reasonable efforts,
    and comparison of results.'
