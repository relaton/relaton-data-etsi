abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this Group Report is to extend the use cases in v1.1.1
    to cover areas such as SmartFood, SmartAgri, SmartIndustry, Multi-modal transport,
    etc, from a cross-domain viewpoint.\r\nWhere possible, material shall be collected
    (by reference) from prior art and existing standards and specifications in this
    area, for example from SmartM2M, oneM2M, H2020 projects. A comprehensive global
    set of use cases is not required, just a set to define the problem space involving
    context management and interworking. Identifying relevant ontologies may be a
    useful byproduct but is not a major goal of this work."
