abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this WI is to produce a Group Report on foreseen scenarios,
    spectrum usage and propose channelization of W-band (92-114.5 GHz) and D-band
    (130-174.8 GHz) to facilitate the deployment of future high capacity backhaul
    systems, able to decongest the network over distances shorter than usual ones
    for transport.\r\nInformation and considerations on the W-band will be included
    where appropriate and beneficial to the WI.\r\nTechnical propagation characteristics
    of W-band and D-band will be analysed.\r\nConsidering that W and D-band  are already
    allocated to FS, part of the scope is to identify applications for future backhaul
    networks or similar applications, propose guidelines for efficient deployment
    in terms of spectrum, license schemes and other relevant aspects in those bands.\r\nOutcomes
    of this analysis are intended to be liaised to SE19, and to other relevant groups"
