abstract:
- content: "Currently EG 202 086 uses the assumption that the operator who is paid
    for the call will have responsibility for this performance. However, with the
    development of competition so that a substantial proportion of calls pass across
    more than one network, it is no longer realistic to consider that any operator
    has overall responsibility for the quality of a call from one user-network interface
    to the other unless the call remains wholly on-net. Responsibility implies choice
    and control, but in many cases this choice and control do not exist.\r\nTherefore
    EG 202 086 is to be revised in order to reflect this situation."
