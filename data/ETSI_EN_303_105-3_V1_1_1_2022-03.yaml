abstract:
- content: This specification covers the next generation transmission system for digital
    hybrid (combination of terrestrial with satellite transmissions) broadcasting
    to handheld terminals making use of a combined terrestrial and satellite transmission.
    The receiver doesn't need to be aware of whereas the received signal stems from
    terrestrial transmitters or satellites or both. The specification specifies the
    differences of the hybrid profile physical layer part to the physical layer part
    of the base profile EN 303 105-1 from the input streams to the transmitted signals.
    This transmission system is intended for carrying Transport Streams or generic
    data streams feeding linear and non-linear applications like television, radio
    and data services. DVB-NGH terminals might also process DVB-T2-lite signals.
