  content: "This Specification specifies the Radio Link Protocol (RLP) for data\r\ntransmission
    over the GSM PLMN. RLP covers the Layer 2 functionality\r\nof the ISO OSI Reference
    Model (IS 7498). It is based on ideas\r\ncontained in IS 3309, IS 4335 and IS
    7809 (HDLC of ISO) as well as\r\nX.25 and Q.92x (LAP-B and LAP-D of CCITT, resp.)
    RLP has been tailored\r\nto the special needs of digital radio transmission. RLP
    provides to\r\nits users the OSI Data Link Service (IS 8886).\r\nRLP is intended
    for use with non-transparent data-transfer. Protocol\r\nconversion may be provided
    for a variety of protocol configurations.\r\nThose foreseen immediately are:\r\n-
    Character-mode protocols using start-stop transmission (IA5);\r\n- X.25 LAP-B.\r\n
    For reasons of better presentation, material about protocol conversion\r\nhas
    been placed within those Specifications concerned with the\r\nrelevant Terminal
    Adaptors, i.e. GSM 07.02 for the asynchronous case\r\nand GSM 07.03 for the synchronous
    case. Care must be taken that that\r\nmaterial also applies to Interworking Functions;
    see GSM 09.04 -\r\n09.07.\r\n  "
