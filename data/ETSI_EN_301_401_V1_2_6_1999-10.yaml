  content: "(Provisional) Attachment requirements for Data Terminal Equipment (DTE)
    to connect to physical and electrical network presentations that are based upon
    the ITU-T V Series of Recommendations. This TBR will combine and harmonize the
    requirements of TBR 1 and TBR 2. The TBR will contain all requirements deemed
    essential under Directive 91/263/EEC to approve terminals within this category
    regardless of the protocols transported accross such interfaces. In particular,
    the TBR will contain requirements for connection to V.10, V.11, V.12, V.28, V.35,
    and V.36 network presentations and will supercede TBR 1 and TBR 2.\r\n\r\nReference
