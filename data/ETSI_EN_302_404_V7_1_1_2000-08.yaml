  content: "This Stage 2 GSM 03.52 document gives an overall description of the lower
    layers of the radio interface for GSM based Cordless Telephony Systems (GSM-CTS).\r\nThe
    GSM-CTS system is intended to provide a cordless connection between the fixed
    network and GSM-based CTS Mobile Stations (CTS-MS) via a private CTS Fixed Part
    (CTS-FP).\r\nStage 1 is an overall description, from the service subscribers and
    user's standpoint, that view the network as a single entity which provides service
    to the user. GSM 02.56 contains the CTS Stage 1 service description.\r\nGSM 03.56
    is a Stage 2 document that describes the system architecture of the GSM Cordless
    Telephone Systems (GSM-CTS), i.e. the system elements, the system interfaces and
    the functional capabilities."
