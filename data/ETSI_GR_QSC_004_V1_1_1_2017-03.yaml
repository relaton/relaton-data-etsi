  content: "Threat and risk assessment for real-world use cases.\r\nThis WI should
    make some reference to these 3 areas:\r\nA.\tWhen a large scale quantum computer
    is expected to be realized and any new threat  this may pose.\r\nB.\tExpected
    to real world use cases e.g. certificate authorities and PKI ; the protocol stack
    ; banking and e-commerce.\r\nC.\tCosts and timescales for industry to migrate
    to Quantum Safe Cryptography. \r\nD.\tRequirements for extensible architectures
    which would support the selection and deployment of the appropriate choice of
    cryptography, where both classical and quantum safe options are available.\r\n"
