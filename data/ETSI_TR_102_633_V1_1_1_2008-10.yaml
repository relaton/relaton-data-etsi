  content: "This Ecma Technical Report is part of a series of publications that provides
    an overview of IP-based enterprise communication involving Corporate telecommunication
    Networks (CNs) (also known as enterprise networks) and in particular Next Generation
    Corporate Networks (NGCN). The series particularly focuses on session level communication
    based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), with an emphasis on inter-domain
    communication. This includes communication between parts of the same enterprise
    (on dedicated infrastructures and/or hosted), between enterprises and between
    enterprises and public networks. Key technical issues are investigated, current
    standardisation work and gaps in this area are identified and a number of requirements
    are stated.\r\n"
