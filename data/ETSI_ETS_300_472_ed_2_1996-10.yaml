  content: "Remove ambiguity in Edition 1 of this ETS.\r\nMethod by which ITU-R System
    B Teletext, also known as World System\r\nTeletext (WST), may be carried in DVB
    bitstreams. This transport\r\nmechanism is intended to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n1.
    Support the transcoding of Teletext data into the Vertical Blanking\r\nInterval
    (VBI) of analogue video, compatible with existing TV\r\nreceivers with Teletext
    decoders.\r\n2. Maximum data rate for each Teletext service is equivalent to 16\r\nlines
    per field so that the service is always suitable for transcoding\r\ninto the VBI.\r\n3.
    Transmission mechanism capable of transmitting subtitles with\r\naccurate timing
    with respect to the video, i.e. within or near frame\r\naccuracy.\r\nA more general
    data transport mechanism for conveying new types of\r\ndata services is outside
    the scope of this document, but the transport\r\nsyntax specified here can also
    be adapted for other data.\r\n  "
