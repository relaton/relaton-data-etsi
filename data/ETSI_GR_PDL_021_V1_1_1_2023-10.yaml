abstract:
- content: "This document will :\r\n-first provide an overview of use cases/scenarios
    of PDL specific to mobile networks by referring deliverables of major existing
    standardization bodies. It aims to form a common view to summarize the key benefits
    of PDL technology to mobile network domain;\r\n-further identify key issues to
    specialize PDL solutions to one or multiple operators' networks among different
    domains and system layers; and study its impact to the mobile network system architecture
    referring 3GPP 5G architecture as a base;\r\n-investigate if there will be any
    necessity to make modifications to the mobile network system architecture (starting
    with 3GPP 5G architecture) in order to integrate PDL in a holistic way."
