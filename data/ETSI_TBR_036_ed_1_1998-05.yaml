abstract:
- content: "This TBR specifies the technical characteristics to be provided by\r\nterminal
    equipment which is capable of connecting to a GSM network\r\n(PLMN) and which
    uses DECT for network access. The cordless\r\ntransmission for such terminal equipment
    operates  within the\r\nfrequency band 1880 - 1900 MHz.\r\n A DECT-terminal equipment
    comprises two elements, referred to as\r\na Fixed Part (FP) and a Portable Part
    (PP). The objective of this\r\nTBR is to ensure air-interface interoperability
    beteween a FP and\r\na PP following the DECT/GSM interworking profile IWP (Note
    2),\r\nwhere these parts are capable of 3,1 kHz telephony applications,\r\nand
    where the FP is connected to the GSM PLMN in order to provide\r\nGSM services
    (according to TBR 19/20) over the DECT air-interface.\r\n For functional parts
    of a FP, that are terminal equipment, which\r\nare declared to conform to the
    basic CTRs for DECT (Note 1) and to\r\nthe DECT/GSM IWP, the requirements of this
    TBR shall apply, in\r\naddition to the attachment requirements for the appropriate
    GSM PLMN.\r\n The requirements of this TBR are also applicable for the complete
    set\r\nof functionality of a PP declared to conform to the DECT/GSM IWP. For\r\na
    PP, this TBR is in addition to the basic CTRs for DECT.\r\n Where a feature is
    indicated as optional, it need not to be provided.\r\nBut where such a feature
    is provided, the FP and/or PP shall conform\r\nto the requirements and tests of
    this TBR. This TBR is structured\r\nto allow type approval of the FP and PP as
    separate items. For each\r\nrequirement in this TBR, a test is given, including
    measurement\r\nmethods where applicable. The terminal equipment may be stimulated\r\nto
    perform the tests by additional equipment if necessary.\r\n This TBR does not
    apply to FPs where they form part of the GSM PLMN.\r\n Note 1: The basic CTR fordDECT
    are the general attachment\r\nrequirements (CTR 6), requirements for telephony
    applications\r\n(CTR 10) and requirements for Generic Access Profile (CTR 22).\r\n
    Note 2:\r\nWith respect to this TBR, the DECT/GSM IWP is based on the provision\r\nof
    access mappings/ interworking requirements of ETS 300 370 and the\r\ngeneral description
    of of services, capabilities and information\r\nflows of prETS 300 466.\r\n  "
