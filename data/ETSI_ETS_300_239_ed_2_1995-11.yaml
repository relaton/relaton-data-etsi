abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) defines the signalling\r\nprotocol
    for the control of Supplementary Services and Additional\r\nNetwork Features (ANF)
    at the Q reference point. The protocol is part\r\nof QSIG. The Q reference point
    exists between Private\r\nTelecommunication Network eXchanges (PTNX) connected
    together within a\r\nPrivate Telecommunication Network (PTN). The Q reference
    point is\r\ndefined in ETS 300 475-1. Detailed procedures applicable to individual\r\nSupplementary
    Services and ANFs are beyond the scope of this ETS and\r\nwill be specified by
    other standards for those services which are\r\nstandardised and by individual
    manufacturers for proprietary services\r\nusing the capabilities defined in this
    ETS.\r\n "
