abstract:
- content: This Technical Specification defines system requirements for operation
    of Mobile Broadband Systems in the 2 300 -2 400 MHz frequency band under Licensed
    Shared Access. The requirements build on the scenarios and applications described
    in ETSI TR 103 113 - Mobile Broadband Services in the 2 300 MHz - 2 400 MHz Frequency
    Band under Licensed Shared Access. The Technical Specification will serve as an
    input for defining the Harmonized Standards and European Standards that are part
    of the EC mandate for Reconfigurable Radio Systems (M/512). Therefore, this work
    will be performed in a close liaison with the Joint Task Force ERM RRS (JTFER)
    related to EC Mandate M/512 and where applicable, additional requirements will
    also be provided by JTFER.
