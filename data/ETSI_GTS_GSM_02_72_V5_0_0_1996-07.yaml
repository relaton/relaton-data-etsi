abstract:
- content: "Call Deflection (CD) enables the served mobile subscriber to respond\r\nto
    an incoming call offered by the network by requesting redirection\r\nof this call
    to another number specified in the response. The CD\r\nsupplementary service can
    only be invoked before the connection is\r\nestablished by the served mobile subscriber,
    i.e. in response to the\r\noffered call, or during the period that the served
    subscriber is being\r\ninformed of the call. The served subscriberâ€™s ability to
    originate\r\ncalls is unaffected by the CD supplementary service.\r\n "
