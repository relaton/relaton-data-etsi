abstract:
- content: "The present document will describe the motivation, requirements, and challenges
    of using flow-oriented on-path telemetry techniques which provides relevant measurement
    or event reports to the AI-enabled network entities.\r\nThe present document will
    outline a reference framework, named as \"In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT)\"
    and identify technical requirements, including: modes of flow-oriented on-path
    telemetry; IFIT-based reactive telemetry framework; and technical requirements,
    including intelligent flow and packet selection, intelligent data export, dynamic
    network probe, on-demand underlying technique selection.\r\n"
