abstract:
- content: "This TBR specifies those technical requirements under\r\nArticles 4.1
    to 4.5 of Council Directive 93/97/EEC that\r\napply to satellite earth station
    equipment that is capable\r\nof operation in one or more of the following frequency
    ranges:\r\n - 10,70 to 11,70 GHz (Space - Earth, shared)\r\n- 12,50 to 12,75 GHz
    (Space - Earth, exclusive)\r\n- 12,75 to 13,25 GHz (Earth - Space, exclusive)\r\n-
    13,75 to 14,25 GHz (Earth - Space, exclusive)\r\n- 14,25 to 14,50 GHz (Earth -
    Space, shared)\r\n of the Fixed Satellite Service (FSS).\r\n These requirements
    are taken from ETS 300 327.\r\n This TBR does not contain the essential requirements
    under Article 4.6\r\nfor interworking via the public telecommunications network
    in\r\njustified cases, and does not provide any guarantee of correct\r\ninterworking
    between satellite earth station equipment.\r\n This TBR specifies the requirements
    for satellite earth station\r\nequipment that\r\n - is capable of being used either
    for transmission only, or for\r\ntransmission and reception (transmit-receive),
    or for reception only\r\n(receive-only), of radio-communication signals in any
    of the bands\r\nspecified above;\r\n - is not within the scope of other Ku-band
    TBRs (TVRO, VSAT, LMES);\r\n - has a diameter of 5,0 m or less;\r\n - is not purpose
    built satellite earth sation equipment intended for\r\nuse as part of the public
    telecommunications network.\r\n This TBR applies to all satellite equipment as
    described above,\r\nirrespective of whether the satellite earth station equipment
    provides\r\nadditional interfaces, telecommunications services or functions.\r\nHowever
    additional TBRs may also apply.\r\n  "
