  content: "This maintenance revision of NFV-SEC 005 will:\r\n\tDescribe current industry
    certificate management approaches (e.g. Enrollment over Secure Transport EST)
    which have been adopted since the publication of NFV-SEC005v1.1.1.\r\n\tProvide
    further guidance on certificate management in NFV, in support of NFV-SOL013 Release
    3. \r\n\tAlign terminology and improve readability.\r\nThis update is also expected
    to provide the basis for subsequent normative work on Certificate Management in
    NFV Release 4.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-SEC005
    provides guidance to the development community on the use of Public Key Certificates,
    Attribute Certificates and the supporting infrastructure, including Registration
    Authorities, and Certificate Authorities. NFV-SEC005 provides this guidance in
    the context of a number of use cases and references to other publications of ETSI
    ISG NFV."
