abstract:
- content: "The present document revises ETSI GR ENI 009.\r\nThe realization of intelligent
    network depends on the big data, AI algorithms and computing resources. Therefore,
    effective data management and operation is extremely important. This work item
    is purposed to draft a GR of data operation requirements and mechanisms to better
    serve ENI system: (1) Data format among the Functional Block of ENI system and
    towards the external world (internal Functional Blocks, Knowledge Representation),
    (2) Data Conversion and possibility to translate AI data model to be adapted to
    / from external system (external trained model imported into ENI), (3) Consistency
    of data format and interface to accelerate the Autonomus Network (AN) evolution
    process and (4) Ensure that customer privacy is not disclosed in the entire lifecycle
    of data collection, processing, and utilization (Federated Learning)"
