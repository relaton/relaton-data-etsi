  content: "The present document specifies generally applicable policy and security
    requirements for Trust Service Providers (TSP) issuing public key certificates,
    including trusted web site certificates.\r\nThe policy and security requirements
    are defined in terms of requirements for the issuance, maintenance and life-cycle
    management of certificates. These policy and security requirements support six
    reference certificate policies. \r\nA framework for the definition of policy requirements
    for TSPs issuing certificates in a specific context where particular requirements
    apply is defined.\r\nThe present document is applicable to:\r\n\tthe general requirements
    of certification in support of cryptographic mechanisms, including electronic
    signatures and electronic seals \r\n\tthe general requirements of certification
    authorities issuing TLS/SSL certificates.\r\n\tthe general requirements of the
    use of cryptography for authentication and encryption\r\nThe present document
    does not specify how the requirements identified can be assessed by an independent
    party, including requirements for information to be made available to such independent
    assessors, or requirements on such assessors.\r\nThe present document however
    provides a check-list of the policy requirements specific to TSP issuing certificates
    (as expressed in the present document) including the generic requirements which
    are independent of the type of service (as expressed in EN 319 401).\r\nThe present
    document includes provisions consistent with the requirements from the CAB Forum
    in EVCG and BRG."
