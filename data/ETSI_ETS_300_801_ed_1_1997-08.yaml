abstract:
- content: "This ETS is the baseline specification for the provision of return\r\nchannel
    based on PSTN and ISDN to DVB Systems.\r\nIt is noted that the DVB does not intend
    to specify a return channel\r\nsolution associated to each broadcast system because
    the\r\ninteroperability of different delivery media to transport the return\r\nchannel
    is desirable. Therefore the PSTN/ISDN solutions for the return\r\nchannel apply
    to satellite, cable, SMATV, terrestrial, MMDS or any\r\nfuture DVB broadcasting
    system.\r\nThe solutions here provided for return channel through PSTN/ISDN are
    a\r\npart of a wider set of alternatives to implement interactive services\r\nfor
    DVB broadcasting systems.\r\n "
