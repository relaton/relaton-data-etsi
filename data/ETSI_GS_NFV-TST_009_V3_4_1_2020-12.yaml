abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-TST 009 conducts NFV Release 3 maintenance. It corrects
    errors, ambiguities, misalignments, and applies editorial modifications (i.e.
    Corrections of category F and D as described in ETSI TWPs Annex L). This edition
    also continues the development of the specification as part of the NFV Release
    3. The scope of the former NFV-TST 009 version is summarized hereafter: \r\n\r\n
    \r\n\r\nNFV-TST 009 specifies vendor-agnostic definitions of performance metrics
    and the associated methods of measurement for Benchmarking networks supported
    in the NFVI. The Benchmarks and Methods will take into account the communication-affecting
    aspects of the compute/networking/virtualisation environment (such as the transient
    interrupts that block other processes or the ability to dedicate variable amounts
    of resources to communication processes). These Benchmarks are intended to serve
    as a basis for fair comparison of different implementations of NFVI, (composed
    of various hardware and software components) according to each individual Benchmark
    and networking configuration evaluated. Note that a Virtual Infrastructure Manager
    (VIM) may play a supporting role in configuring the network under test.\r\nExamples
    of existing Benchmarks include IETF?RFC?2544 Throughput and Latency (developed
    for physical network functions)."
