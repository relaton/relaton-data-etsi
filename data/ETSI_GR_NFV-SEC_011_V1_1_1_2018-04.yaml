  content: "NFV virtualised networks are required to be able to support Lawful Interception
    (LI). In order for virtual functions to support LI, the NFV virtualisation layer
    must provide a set of capabilities, interfaces, functions and components which
    can be utilised by the virtualised applications (VNFs) to provide Lawful Interception.
    This report will identify potential top to bottom (Virtualised Application through
    NFV layer through hardware platform) LI architectures and identify within the
    scope of ETSI NFV, capabilities, interfaces, functions and components required
    to support these architectures.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of this work item are
    to\r\n\tidentify  and define 1 or more NFV reference LI architectures, including
    administration functions, virtual points of interception, mediation functions
    and other LI functions.\r\n\tIdentify potential NFV solutions which provide the
    capabilities, interfaces, functions and components to meet the identified LI architectures.
    \ \r\n\tDocument deployment scenarios examples for each of the identified reference
    LI architectures\r\n\r\nThis work will build on applicable work already undertaken
    in NFV SEC 004 & 009.\r\n\r\nThis work may include collaboration with other work
    groups, e.g. IFA WG.\r\n\r\nThis Report is expected to form the basis from which
    a future normative NFV LI architecture can be developed.\r\n"
