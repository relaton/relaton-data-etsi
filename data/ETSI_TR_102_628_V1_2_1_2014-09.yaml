abstract:
- content: Additional spectrum requirements for future TETRA emergency systems in
    the UHF frequency range. This spectrum is for future public safety wide area coverage
    interoperable communications. High speed data application requirements need also
    to be supported. The aim of the present revision of the SRDoc is to include more
    detailed calculations to justify the requirements, and to update the document
    to reflect the changes in the external environment since publication of the initial
    version of the SRDoc.
