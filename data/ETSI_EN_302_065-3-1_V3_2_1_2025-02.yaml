  content: "This work item to amend the former version of EN 302 065 Part 3, v2.1.1
    (Requirements for UWB devices for ground based vehicular applications) to address
    the request of the EU desk officer. This includes a detailed description of the
    wanted performance criterion, RX-requirements and fixed limits for all requirements
    based on a clear test procedure.\r\nTherefore, this EN will cover vehicle installed
    devices for UWB based vehicular access systems for operation in 6 GHz to 8,5 GHz
    frequency ranges, using Trigger-before-Transmit mitigation technique. It applies
    to Category A (proximity verification) and Category B (proximity monitoring) systems
    as introduced in TR 103 416 V1.1.1 respectively ECC Report 278.\r\nA first collection
    of open points which shall be considered (in addition) are uploaded as: TGUWB[17]040001
    and TGUWB(17)040007\r\n"
