abstract:
- content: "Scope of work to be undertaken:  \r\nThis Technical Report will collect
    operating network scenarios - to be described in the form of system use cases
    - for Reconfigurable Radio Systems and operating in IMT bands and GSM bands i.e.
    licensed spectrums allocated to IMT and GSM systems.\r\nUse cases will focus on
    intra-operator scenarios for which the spectrum resources are assigned to and
    managed by a single operator.\r\nUse cases will be described at the system functionality
    level and must not be confused with the features/requirements of the system under
    consideration i.e. A use case may be related to one or more features/requirements,
    a feature/requirement may be related to one or more use cases.\r\nUse Cases will
    identify actors and information flows, and will form the basis of system requirements
    work at TC RRS for Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems and Cognitive Radio (CR)
    systems. \r\nIt is expected that the focus on such harmonized, global and regulated
    spectrum environment will help clarifying opportunities and impacts of cognitive
    radio and software defined radio systems."
