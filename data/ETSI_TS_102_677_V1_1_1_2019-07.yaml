  content: "Service and network architectures are increasingly becoming non-monolithic,
    with multiple operators involved in supplying a service to a single user.  It
    is not unusual for the service provider at the application/signalling layer to
    be different from the access provider. \r\nIn addition, for some services it is
    necessary to have the option to perform interception in the core network where
    there is not always a link between the identifies used in the application layer
    (eg IMS IMPUs/IMPI) and the identifiers used in the access / transport domain
    (generally IP Address).\r\nThe present document considers the issues and develop
    solutions in existing TC LI standards for both single operator scenarios and multiple
    cooperating operators (either by mutual operator commercial arrangements or regulator
    requirements)."
