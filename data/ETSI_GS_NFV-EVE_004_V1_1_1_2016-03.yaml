abstract:
- content: "Although the NFV architecture is not tied to hypervisor-based solutions,
    the detailed specifications (e.g. MANO) are biased towards these solutions.  The
    hypervisor approach has some cost in terms of efficiency and the scalability may
    not be sufficient for cases where a huge number of virtualisation containers need
    to be deployed and managed.  \r\n\r\nThe scope of this work item is twofold: \r\n
    - Identtify the impact of using alternative virtualisation technologies on the
    NFV framework and specifications, and propose appropriate changes. \r\n- Provide
    an analysis of the pros and cons of these alternative technologies  Alternative
    virtualisation technologies to be considered include – but are not limited to
    – the following ones: \r\n\t - Container-based operating system virtualization
    such as LXC \r\n\t- Higher layer container technology such as Java virtual machines
    \ \r\n\r\nThe deliverable will contain informative material only, including recommendations
    on how to modify other ETSI NFV specifications to cover Non hypervisor-based virtualisation.
    These modifications are expected to be performed under separate work items.\r\n"
