abstract:
- content: "This Global System for Mobile communications Technical Specification (\r\nGTS)
    identifies the routeing scenarios possible for calls between Publ\r\nic Data Networks
    (PDN s) and the GSM PLMN. As one of the prime means o\r\nf routeing is based on
    the subscriber number, this recommendation init\r\nially defines the numbering
    principles for interworking between PLMN s\r\nand PDN s. These principles indicate:\r\n-\tpresent
    PDN procedures when aiming at single stage interworking for\r\nthe near term;
    and\r\n -\tfuture PDN procedures exploiting the 15 digit and intelligent signal\r\nling
    capabilities of the ISDN as the long term solution.\r\n Further routeing scenarios
    are presented for PDN originated calls to m\r\nobile subscribers who are roaming
    on a foreign PLMN.\r\n "
