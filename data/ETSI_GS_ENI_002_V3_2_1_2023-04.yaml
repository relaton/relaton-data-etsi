  content: "The purpose of the present document is to specify his document specifies
    the requirements of how intelligence is applied to the network and applications
    in different scenarios to improve experience of service provision and network
    operation. Also, how intelligence enables dynamic autonomous behaviour and adaptive
    policy driven operation in a changing context. The ENI requirements are based
    on the ENI use case document and identified requirements from other SDOs. These
    requirements will form the base for the architecture design work.\r\n\r\nIn Release
    3 the Specification will add:\r\n Requirements derived from API descriptions\r\n
    Requirements derived from System Architecture\r\n Requirements derived from new
    use cases."
