abstract:
- content: The document reports on impacts of NFV-MANO failures and overload conditions,
    including human errors, on the availability and reliability of NFV-MANO. A set
    of use cases will be described and analysed which include interactions between
    NFV-MANO functional entities under such conditions and other functional blocks
    (VNF, EM, OSS, â€¦).  Also situations are analysed, where availability is achieved
    by a system of collaborating NFV-MANO functional entities possibly provided by
    different vendors. As a result, recommendations for the requirements of an available
    and reliable NFV-MANO system will be derived.
