abstract:
- content: "The present document defines the requirements for radio frequency usage
    for Ultra Wide Band (UWB) location tracking devices. \r\nThese devices operate
    in the frequency range from 6 GHz to 8.5 GHz and use a fixed infrastructure. \r\nIt
    covers Ultra Wide Band location tracking tags which are attached to people or
    objects and are tracked using a fixed infrastructure.\r\nNote:\r\nThe difference
    between version 1.2.1 of TR 102 495-3 and version 1.3.1 of TR 102 495-3 is that
    this new version covers indoor and portable or mobile outdoor applications under
    the conditions of the generic ECC decision as amended in July 2007."
