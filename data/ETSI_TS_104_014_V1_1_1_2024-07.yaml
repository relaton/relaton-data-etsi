  content: The aim is to deliver a specification of a file exchange extension for
    the Pan-European Mobile Emergency Application (PEMEA). This new capability allows
    applications and PSAP to share files when the PSAP requests so, e.g. PSAPs could
    request photos or videos from the scene, and would be allowed to send images or
    files with instructions to the applications based, for example in a location where
    a Mass Casualty Incident is taking place.
