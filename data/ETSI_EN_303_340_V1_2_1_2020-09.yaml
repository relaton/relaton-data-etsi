  content: "1) To include additional signal generator file formats for the interferer
    waveforms \r\n2) To study the overload limit for DTT broadcast receivers with
    preamplifier switched on in accordance with draft ETSI EN 303 340 v1.0.1 Table
    7, Note 3 which states: Note 3: For broadcast receivers with optional preamplifier
    switched on, test 1 will apply at the initial introduction of the RED. Due to
    the short timescales imposed by the RED, only existing broadcast receiver designs
    can be considered in these timescales, because design changes to broadcast receivers
    can take up to three years. Further study and prototyping by the manufacturers
    of broadcast receivers, tuner modules and silicon devices is necessary to assess
    the feasibility of the proposed enhanced target overload limit of test 2. This
    study will be completed by 13 June 2017 when the limits for test 1 can be reviewed
    with an intention of revising the limit towards the target values described in
    test 2, applicable from 13 June 2019."
