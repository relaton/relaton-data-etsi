  content: "This work item will apply QuEST Forum quality management best practices
    (especially TL 9000 Measurements Handbook) and TM Forum SLA management standards
    (especially GB917 and TR178) to the ETSI NFV architecture.  The intent of this
    framework is to promote the development of capabilities by which VNFs, NFV infrastructure
    and MANO can eventually enable rapid and reliable root cause analysis of service
    quality impairments, corrective action, and SLA management.  This document will:\r\n1.\tDefine
    high level roles, service boundaries and identify associated NFV reference points;
    and their quality-related responsibilities to enable rapid root cause analysis
    and corrective actions\r\n2.\talign high level roles with TMForums SLA management
    service delivery relationships\r\n3.\tframe how traditional PNF quality measurements
    (e.g., TL 9000 Service Outage measurements) will be applied to VNFs to permit
    side-by-side quality comparions, and enable traditional quality measurement (e.g.,
    service outage downtime) for new NFV architectural elements\r\nThe resulting deliverable
    will reuse work performed in other relevant NFV Work Items, and collaborate with
    the corresponding WGs.\r\n"
