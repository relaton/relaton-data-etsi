abstract:
- content: "This work item seeks to understand how PDL can be employed in standardized
    oneM2M IoT service layer platforms through various use cases. Additionally, this
    work item will explore various mechanisms to utilize PDL by interworking with
    the oneM2M standardized IoT platform. Specifically, this work item will deliver
    a report that covers the following aspects: \r\n1). Investigate use cases that
    utilise PDL in oneM2M IoT Service Layer Platform\r\n2). Identify features that
    can support interworking between PDL and oneM2M\r\n3). Study a potential interworking
    mechanism between PDL and oneM2M\r\n"
