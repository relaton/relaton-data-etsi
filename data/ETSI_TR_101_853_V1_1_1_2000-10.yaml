  content: "Study and definition of co-existence of P-MP systems using different access
    methods and having different characteristics within the same access methods.\r\nApplication
    for frequency planning purposes including sharing with P-P systems and for exploiting
    the frequency bands efficiently. To extend the possible application of P-MP systems
    in dense access networks."
