  content: This study item focuses on identifying the additional support that needs
    to be provided by MEC when MEC applications run as containers.  The work will
    be a study with the intent to collect and analyze the use cases relating to deployment
    of containers, evaluate the gaps from the currently defined MEC functionalities,
    if exist, and identify new requirements. As ETSI NFV is also working on containers,
    the MEC work should be aligned, where applicable. The study item will recommend
    the necessary normative work to close the gaps, if applicable.
