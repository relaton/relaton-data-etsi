  content: This Technical Specification will define the RRS system requirements for
    Reconfigurable Radio Systems operating in IMT-Bands and GSM-Bands i.e. licensed
    spectrum allocated to IMT and GSM systems. The potential system requirements defined
    for the operating network scenarios identified in TR 103 063 will be used to categorize
    and derive more specific and detailed system requirements. This Technical Specification
    will consider the system requirements only for intra-operator scenarios for which
    the spectrum resources are assigned to and managed by a single operator.
