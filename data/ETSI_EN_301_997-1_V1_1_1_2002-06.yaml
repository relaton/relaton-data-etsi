  content: " Equipment performance characteristics and parameters necessary to facilitate
    coexistence between broadband Multimedia Wireless Systems (MWS) in either;\r\nadjacent
    frequency assignments in the same geographical area.\r\nor\r\nco-frequency assignments
    in neighbouring geographical areas.\r\n\r\nMultimedia Wireless Systems are defined
    \ as terrestrial multipoint systems which have their origin in telecommunication
    and/or broadcasting, and which provide fixed wireless access direct to the end
    user for  multimedia services. These MWS systems may offer different degrees of
    interactivity.Therefore systems are anticipated that could deliver services requiring
    either asymmetric data rates, (including uni-directional distribution systems)
    or symmetric data rates between uplink and downlink. Any asymmetry between uplink
    and downlink may be fixed or dynamically variable to suit the traffic characteristics
    at any time.\r\n\r\nThis standard covers equipments that operate within the frequency
    band 40.5 to 43.5 GHz.\r\n"
