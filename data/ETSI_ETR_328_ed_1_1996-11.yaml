abstract:
- content: "This ETR describes a transmission technique called Asymmetric Digital\r\nSubscriber
    Line (ADSL). The requirements for the ADSL transmission sys\r\ntem and the transmission
    performance are defined in this report.\r\nADSL allows the provision of a variety
    of digital channels on the same\r\n, single subscriber line as the analogue telephone
    service. An ADSL sy\r\nstem contains several digital channels. Some of them are
    full duplex l\r\now-speed channels and the others are simplex high-speed channels.
    The\r\nhigh-speed channels are transported only in the direction to the custo\r\nmer
    premises.\r\n This ETR is based on ANSI T1.413 [1] provided by the ANSI committee
    T1\r\nE1.4 and contains only specific European topics not covered by ANSI T1\r\n
