  content: This work item aims at studying how operations data (KPIs, metrics, alarm
    notifications, event logs, debug information) can be exploited to ensure the availability
    and reliability of NFV-MANO and of the network services it manages using data
    analysis/data driven techniques. This includes, among others, the use of machine
    learning to find patterns for cases where detailed semantics information is unavailable
    (e.g. due to confidentiality) or the amount of data is overwhelming. Use cases
    will be created describing how the information can be used offline (for example
    for root cause analysis and predictive maintenance resulting in, e.g. creation
    and/or changes of deployment flavours) and online (to identify appropriate LCM
    operations and policy changes in order to achieve the intended service availability
    objectives).
