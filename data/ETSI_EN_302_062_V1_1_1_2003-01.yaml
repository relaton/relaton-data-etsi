abstract:
- content: "Define a new standard for high capacity radio systems suitable for 2xSTM-1,
    4 x STM-1 capacities with baseband interfaces of STM-1 and STM-4.  The systems
    use high order modulation with co-channel dual-polarized (CCDP) operation for
    the 4xSTM-1 payload capacity. The channel spacing is 55/56 MHz.\r\n\r\n"
