  content: "The SRdoc aims to provide information on the intended applications, the
    technical parameters, the relationship to the existing spectrum regulation (2017/1483/EU
    and ERC REC Annex 6) and new radio spectrum requirements for High-Definition Ground
    Based Synthetic Aperture Radars (HD-GBSAR). \r\nA 1 GHz bandwidth is required
    and could be accommodated in the frequency range between 74 and 81 GHz.\r\nThe
    SRdoc will include necessary information to support the co-operation between ETSI
    and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European Conference of
    Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), including:  Detailed market
    information (annex A);  Technical information (annex B);  Relationship to the
    existing spectrum regulation (annex C);  Preliminary  compatibility feasibility
    analysis (annex D). \r\nHD-GBSAR requirements in respect to the intended applications
    will be provided e.g to measure and monitor the deformation of building either
    to assess the stability of a building, or to control instabilities induced by
    external cause, such as earthquake, underground construction close or under the
    building, etc. Another key application is monitoring the deformation evolution
    of natural landslide, with the goal to provide early warning alert in case of
    failure precursor.\r\n"
