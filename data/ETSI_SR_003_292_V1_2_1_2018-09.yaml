abstract:
- content: "There is a lot of confusion around implementation of LI for LTE and related
    services, and the split in work areas between TC LI and SA3 LI. This document
    proposes to provide guidance to interested parties on what is available, how it
    may be interpreted and dispel a number of confusing items or myths. It is in the
    format of an Frequently Asked Questions document.\r\nThis revision is for a correction
    to Table 1 (Overview of international LI standards)."
