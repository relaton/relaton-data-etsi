  content: "This TR will address technical difficulties and set out recommendations
    for the assessment of combined products for compliance to articles 3.1b and 3.2
    of the R&TTE directive 1999/5 EC.\r\nThis part of the TR will provide guidance
    on the application of radio product standards for combined products under article
    3.2 of the R&TTE directive 1999/5/EC.\r\nExamples to be covered include: multiple
    radios, radio in IT/domestic equipment etc. \r\nThe recommendations made in this
    TR may lead to amendments of the relevant radio product standards or the creation
    of a stand alone harmonised standard for combined products."
