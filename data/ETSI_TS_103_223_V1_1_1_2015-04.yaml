abstract:
- content: "This Technical Standard will define a mastering format for object-based
    audio destine for eventual rendering in a consumer environment. The MDA bitstream
    contains uncompressed audio with a rich metadata set. The MDA Specification will
    also include all the components necessary for the interoperable distribution and
    playback of object-based audio such as syntax and bitstream definitions as well
    as a reference renderer.\r\nMDA is intended for use in live streaming/broadcast
    contribution applications, as well as in post-production. It can serve as the
    input to all next generation consumer delivery systems that are designed to compress,
    carry, and preserve the object-based audio payload and metadata. Payload can consist
    of any combination of object-based, channels-based, or scene-based audio. "
