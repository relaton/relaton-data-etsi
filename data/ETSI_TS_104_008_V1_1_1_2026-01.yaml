abstract:
- content: The present document covers the Continuous Auditing Based Conformity Assessment
    (CABCA) process for AI-enabled systems, including its definition, principles,
    tasks and benefits compared to traditional "point-in-time" certifications. CABCA
    is examplified in an MLOps setup, which involves the assessment of ML artifacts
    like data sets, model architecture, parameters and metrics.
