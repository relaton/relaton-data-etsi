  content: "This work item focuses on a non-IP network protocol architecture based
    on RINA design principles. Network architecture in the scope of this WI is defined
    as the rules and patterns that are independent of the requirements addressed by
    individual network protocols, and therefore apply to all forms of networking.
    Such network architecture would provide SDOs and network protocol designers with
    a common framework and methodology to design and build protocols for any type
    of network. The goal is to describe invariants for network structure, protocol
    design, naming and addressing, security and network management that are applicable
    to any type of networked environment and use case. \r\n"
