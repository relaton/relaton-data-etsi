  content: "The present document defines specific QCStatement for the qcStatements
    extension as defined in RFC 3739, including requirements for their use in EU qualified
    certificates. Some of these QCStatements can be used for other forms of certificate.\r\nThe
    QCStatements defined in the present document can be used in combination with any
    certificate profile, either defined in parts 2, 3 and 4, or defined elsewhere.\r\nThe
    QCStatements may be applied to regulatory environments outside the EU. Other requirements
    are specific to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 but may be adapted for other regulatory
    environments."
