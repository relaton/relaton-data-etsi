abstract:
- content: "This ETS defines the architecture of layer 3\r\nand its sublayers on the
    GSM Um interface, i.e. the interface between\r\nmobile station and network. It
    also defines the basic message format\r\nand error handling applied by the layer
    3 protocols.\r\nThe corresponding protocols are defined elsewhere:\r\n- the Radio
    Resource (RR) management protocol is defined in TS\r\nGSM 04.08;\r\n- the Mobility
    Management (MM) protocol is defined in TS GSM\r\n04.08;\r\n- the Call Control
    (CC) protocol is defined in TS GSM 04.08;\r\n- the Supplementary Services (SS)
    protocol is defined in TS GSM\r\n04.10, TS GSM 04.8x and TS GSM 04.9x;\r\n- The
    Short Message Service (SMS) protocol is defined in TS GSM\r\n04.11.\r\n The communication
    between sublayers and adjacent layers and the\r\nservices provided by the sublayers
    are distributed by use of abstract\r\nservice primitives. But only externally
    observable behaviour resulting\r\nfrom the description is normatively prescribed
    by this Technical\r\nSpecification.\r\n "
