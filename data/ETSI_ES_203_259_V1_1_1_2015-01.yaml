abstract:
- content: "This document defines the requirements necessary for the Configuration,
    Fault Management, and Performance Management of the Converged Cable Access Platform
    (CCAP) system. The intent of this specification is to define a common, cross-vendor
    set of functionality for the configuration and management of CCAPs.\r\nThis specification
    defines a standard configuration object model for the configuration of the CCAP.
    This specification also defines the SNMP Management requirements for a CCAP. These
    SNMP requirements include both protocol conformance and management object definitions,
    based largely upon existing industry standard management objects found in DOCSIS
    CMTSs and Universal EQAMs. In addition, this specification defines the standard
    Event Messaging requirements of a CCAP system."
