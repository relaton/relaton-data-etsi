abstract:
- content: "This Work Item will initially focus on the creation of a Technical Report
    analysing existing AI technologies (incl. Machine Learning) that can be resourced
    into oneM2M architecture. The TR will also investigate potential AI service use
    cases that use IoT data. The study on AI technologies and use cases will be further
    analysed to understand what features are supported and unsupported by the oneM2M
    system. Unsupported features will be used to generate potential requirements.
