abstract:
- content: 'Considering TS 102 650 and architectures from other standardisation organisations
    a single functional architecture to support European requirements on emergency
    caller location determination and transport needs to be developed in particular
    for the case where VoIP service provider and one or several network operators  -
    all serving the customer in the establishment of an emergency call -  are independent
    enterprises needing to co-operate to determine the location of the (nomadic) caller.
    The architecture shall identify all necessary interfaces, which are needed to
    fulfil the requirements outlined in EC Mandate M/493, and provide a basis for
    possible protocols to be used on those interfaces. Environmental aspect comments:
    1) The establishment of emergency calls and the provision of location information
    about the caller shall not be hampered by high service or network loads or partial
    service or network outages. (2) The location information shall be provided to
    the PSAP in a manner that it is easily associated with the respective incoming
    voice call. (3) Location related information accurate enough to allow routing
    of the call must be constrained to those entities that require it in order to
    deliver the call to the correct PSAP. (4) Accurate location information shall
    be obtained from at least a trustworthy source. A CPE may not be  considered trustworthy.
    User /Consumer Aspects comments: 1) The location should be determined as fast
    as possible. (2) Should the location determination fail for any reason, the emergency
    call is still to be setup without delay. (3) The access to and the provision of
    location information shall be strictly limited to emergency calls only. (4) The
    architecture shall not be based on location information provided by an entity
    controlled by the user. Security Aspects  (1) The access to location information
    shall be strictly limited to cases of an emergency call. (2) Location information
    sufficiently detailed to dispatch personnel and resources shall only be provided
    to the PSAP handling the emergency call.'
