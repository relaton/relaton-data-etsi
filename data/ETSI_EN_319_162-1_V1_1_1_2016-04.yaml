abstract:
- content: "To produce an European Norm that will specify  formats for Associated
    Signature Containers (ASiC). These are containers that bind together a collection
    of signed data objects with Advanced Electronic signatures (XAdES or CAdES) applied
    to them, or with time-stamps computed on them. It will include an ASiC building
    blocks and the ASiC Baseline containers.    \r\n\r\nASiC core specification part
    will evolve the latest version of ETSI TS 102 918; ASiC Baseline Profile part
    will evolve the latest version of ETSI TS 103 174.  The work will include the
    identification and agreement of relevant issues to deal with during the evolution
    of the aforementioned TSs to EN parts.\r\nPart 1 specifies the core specification
    with the format for a single container binding together a number of signed objects
    (e.g. documents, XML structured data, spreadsheet, multimedia content) with either
    Advanced Electronic Signatures or time-stamps. This uses package formats based
    on ZIP and supports the following signature and time-stamp token formats: CAdES
    signature(s) as specified in EN 19 122, XAdES detached signature(s) as specified
    in EN 19 132; and RFC 3161 time-stamp tokens."
