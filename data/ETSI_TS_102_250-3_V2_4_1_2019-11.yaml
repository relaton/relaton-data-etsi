abstract:
- content: The revision of the present document is to provide structural integrity
    and wording alignment across the multi-part document TS 102 250-1 to -7, by updating
    the introduction in order to take into account the publication of part 8 of this
    TS series. The update ensures consistent cross-referencing and wording between
    parts 1 to 7 of the series and restricts the listing of all parts to the overarching
    part 1 umbrella document.
