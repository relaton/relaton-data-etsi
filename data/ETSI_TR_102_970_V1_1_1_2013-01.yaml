  content: 'The scope of this work item is to identify and define the potential spectrum
    and network usage among Public Safety, Commercial or Military. Different types
    of services for different user organizations may be provided through one or several
    network operators that may have a different degree of control over the resources
    of the network. The work item has the following objectives: 1) Identify a taxonomy
    of spectrum and network usage solutions. 2) Describe the technical architecture
    of each solution. 3) Identify business (e.g. Service Level Agreement between concerned
    parties) and organisational issues which could support or hinder the development
    of each solution. The following principles shall be of primary importance in the
    definition of the work:  Evolution path of TETRA and other Public Safety networks
    for the long term (> 2025).  Within the definition of possible procedures, those
    that allow Public Safety applications to have precedence and strict pre-emption
    over other non-Public-Safety applications will be specifically addressed.  Identification
    of the main interfaces between Public Safety networks and other networks to support
    interoperability at MS and BS levels and joint resource management. The output
    of the work item will be a technical report.'
