  content: "The purpose of this WI is to move the biometric authentication from TS
    103 732 v1.1.1 to a separate module.\r\nThe work also focuses on the following
    aspects:\r\nIterate requirements for clarity;\r\ninclude feedback from laboratories
    and vendors performing current evaluations;\r\nChanges due to the PP certification
    process.\r\nAdditional changes may be considered as needed to ensure consistency
    within the document and with part 1.\r\nThe WI will also consider any changes
    which may be necessary to support a possible GSMA certification scheme based on
    TS 103 732.\r\n"
