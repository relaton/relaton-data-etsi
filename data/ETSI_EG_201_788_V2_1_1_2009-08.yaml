abstract:
- content: "????? Originally, SRdocs (System Reference documents were informal documents
    exchanged between ETSI and CEPT; subsequently, in order to enhance visibility,
    it was decided to publish them as TRs (EG 201 788 v 121 provides the corresponding
    guidance).\r\nAs the EC is more and more involved in activities related to Spectrum
    Management, SRdocs increasingly widely circulated. Usually, in the various WG
    of the ECC, there are ETSI LOs who can present SRdocs  (and, in particular, confirm
    their status) ; this is not necessarily the case in relation to the EC. This has
    implications on the way SRdocs are drafted. Hence, the work to be done.\r\nComments
    made during the ECC-ETSI officials meeting (document ERM_36_25a1 and related comments
    during TC ERM #36 meeting) and the RSPG Opinion on Streamlining are to be taken
    into account as well.\r\nFinally, see also documents RM 38 (08) PAR 5  and  RM
    38 (08) PAR 18."
