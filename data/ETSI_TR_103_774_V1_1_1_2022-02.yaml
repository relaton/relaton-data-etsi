abstract:
- content: The System Reference Document will describe technical characteristics of
    Radio Equipment for power transfer and communication with associated peripheral
    devices, and operating within the frequency range 917,3 – 917,7 MHz (for power
    transfer) and 2,4 GHz Bluetooth or another frequency (for control signalling).
    The application is intended for indoor use and has the same radio characteristics
    as existing RFID interrogators in the 917,3 – 917,7 MHz band (i.e. maximum power
    of 4W e.r.p. and maximum bandwidth of 400 kHz) as considered in ECC Report 200.
    The document will  include the necessary information to support the co-operation
    between ETSI and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European
    Conference of Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT).
