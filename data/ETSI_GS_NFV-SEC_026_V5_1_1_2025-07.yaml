abstract:
- content: "This work item will define the requirements and solutions for the NFV
    System to enhance network functions and services isolation between tenants. This
    includes:  \r\no\tAnalysis of the threat models\r\no\tTrust domain separation
    (multi-tenant NFVI, traffic and resource separation, tenant-dependant resource
    management and access control..)\r\no\tMemory protection and access control (protection
    against memory introspection, confidentiality of sensitive data and credentials),
    \r\no\tHypervisor trust partitioning\r\no\tThe Virtualization Container (e.g.
    Virtual Machine and OS container) Escape protection (e.g. protection against VNF
    compromizing its local host OS, taking control of the hypervisor and then gaining
    access to private and sensitive data of co-resident Virtualization Containers)
    .\r\no\tAssociated key management system for all above items.\r\nThe WI will take
    into account the output of GR NFV-EVE018 WI concerning the multi-tenancy.\r\n"
