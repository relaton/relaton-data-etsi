  content: "This work includes \r\n- merging of current versions of part 1 and 2.
    \ \r\n- Revision of current standard parts to cover the essential requirements
    of article 3.2 of the RE-D.  \r\n- Clarifications in the measurement procedure
    and of the regulation framework. \r\n-  the inclusion of possible missing elements
    of old   EN 302 291 (which should be withdrawn then)\r\n- to clarify if 300330
    could cover systems operating below 9 kHz. \r\nNote: A NWI for a TR will have
    to be established to evaluate the current situation and possible future use of
    radio applications in the frequency range below 9 kHz. This TR will be propaedeutic
    then for the possible subsequent full standardisation activity. "
