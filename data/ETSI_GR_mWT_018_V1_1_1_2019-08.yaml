abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this WI is to produce a Group report on foreseen scenarios,
    spectrum usage and propose channelization of W-band (92-114.5 GHz) to facilitate
    the deployment of future high capacity backhaul systems, able to decongest the
    network over distances shorter than usual ones for transport. Technical propagation
    characteristics of W-band will be analysed. Considering that W is already allocated
    to FS, part of the scope is to identify applications for future backhaul networks
    or similar applications. Given that no standardized channel plan is available
    yet for W band, guidelines for efficient deployment in terms of spectrum, license
    schemes and other relevant aspects in those bands are proposed. Licenses also
    for non-operator services are considered, in the vision of market share. Outcomes
    of this analysis are intended to be liaised to SE19, and to other relevant groups
    identified in due course, as contribution for discussion.\r\n"
