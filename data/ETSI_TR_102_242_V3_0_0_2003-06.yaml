  content: "The scope of the work item is to identify the risk of noise perturbation
    on the Terminal/UICC interface in a 1.8V operating environment and to produce
    a report that could outline potential modifications  to the interface to improve
    its robustness.\r\nAs no 3G live environment may be available and as the 1.8V
    card technology may not be broadly available for the testing, the first investigations
    might have to be conveyed on 2G equipments operating at 3V, and the results extrapolated
    to the target environment.\r\nTests may have to be done on a significant number
    of Terminals and SIM cards. Thus the support of as much as possible Network Operators,
    Terminal Manufacturers, Card Manufacturers and Silicon Manufacturers is required
    to collect the required data.\r\nIf the Technical Report concludes so, solutions
    to improve noise immunity and robustness on the interface, CRs will be produced
    accordingly."
