  content: "This revision of NFV-TST 007 conducts NFV Release 2 maintenance. It corrects
    errors, ambiguities, misalignments, and applies editorial modifications (i.e.
    Corrections of category F and D as described in ETSI TWPs Annex L). This edition
    does not add or modify features, nor does it extend the scope of the former Release
    2 edition summarized hereafter\r\n\r\nTST 007 provides informative interoperability
    test guidelines for NFV capabilities requiring interaction among VNF, MANO and
    VIM-NFVI, such as (but not limited to): NS Lifecycle Management, VNF Lifecycle
    management, VNF Package Management, Software Image Management,... The document
    follows the Interoperability Testing Methodology developed by the NFV TST WG (TST002)
    and is intended to be applicable for all implementations aligned with ETSI NFV
    architecture; references to open source implementations may be included as examples."
