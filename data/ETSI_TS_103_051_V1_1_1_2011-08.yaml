  content: Investigate and possibly revise measurement uncertainty values based on
    new information on state-of-the-art measurements including impact assessment Include
    values for expanded measurement uncertainty for measurements at higher frequencies,
    also taking into account new work in ERM for radio applications at EHF frequencies.
    Specification on how expanded measurement uncertainty is addressed in measurement
    reports. Add specifications for frequencies below 1 GHz as proposed by document
    ERM_33_093 Add structures for the description of the methods of measurement (see
    proposal in ERM_33_093). Update and add references. Thorough review of current
    version of document TR 102 215. Upgrade of TR 102 215 to TS.
