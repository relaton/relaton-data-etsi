abstract:
- content: "This GTS specifies the\r\nstage 1 description of Explicit Call Transfer
    (ECT) from the service\r\nsubscriber s and user s points of view, in particular:\r\n-
    the procedures for normal operation with successful outcome;\r\n- the action to
    be taken in exceptional circumstances;\r\n- the interaction with other Global
    System for Mobile\r\ncommunications (GSM) supplementary services.\r\n This TS
    does not deal with the Man-Machine Interface (MMI)\r\nrequirements, but makes
    reference to the appropriate GSM Technical\r\nSpecification and ETS.\r\nThe charging
    principles applied to ECT are established in this\r\nstandard in terms of the
    charging information required to be\r\ncollected. Any subsequent charging implications
    are outside of the\r\nscope of this TS.\r\nThis ETS is applicable to the digital
    cellular telecommunication\r\nsystem GSM. Any interactions with other networks
    not dealt with in\r\nClause 9 are outside the scope of this TS.\r\n"
