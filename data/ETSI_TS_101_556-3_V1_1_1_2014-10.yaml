  content: The scope of this document is the specification of wireless application
    protocols and messages supporting the discovery of offered services (completing
    related discovery protocols), charging spot reservation (and possible renegotiation),
    pre-payment of the service reservation in the vehicle (involving pre-payment support
    or contract validation), and application-level logical pairing of the Electric
    Vehicle to a selected charging spot. Requirements regarding the underlying transport
    and network layer services will be also defined. This process starts from the
    journey planning phase and continues during the driving phase, terminating with
    the approach of the reserved parking / fast recharge / quick drop area. The work
    will be achieved in consistency with the ongoing standardisation, e.g. ISO/IEC
    15118, IEC 62196-2. The scope includes support of different electrical energy
    provisioning modes, such as wired, quick drop or inductive recharging.
