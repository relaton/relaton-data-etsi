abstract:
- content: The work shall develop human factors guidelines within  the EC IST-1999-11577
    project Eye-2-Eye (Fitness-for-Purpose of Person-Person Communication Technologies).  The
    Eye-2-Eye guidelines are primarily generated from the empirical results of its
    laboratory experiments and field study.  The communication services examined are
    real-time text, audio-conferencing, avatar-telephony, videoconferencing and multimedia
    conferencing.  Service aspects include audio-video synchrony, video resolution,
    video delay, packet loss and monitor size.  Data are collected for a range of
    objective and subjective measures of user behaviour and opinion.  The guidelines
    are intended primarily for network providers, service providers, content providers,
    equipment manufacturers and standards bodies.  The work shall develop the guidelines
    for their relevance to ETSI and deliver a review of key issues for standards bodies
    with recommendations for future actions.
