  content: "This technical specification has two parts:\r\nThe first part defines
    a set of QoS primitives and proxy manager to be located at the ingress of the
    BSM to identify and map Diffserv markings to BSM traffic classes (and the inverse
    at the egress); this is for the content delivery scenario and when the BSM will
    be involved in interdomain communications.\r\nThe second part defines the BPM
    component responsible for negotiating and managing codepoint values with attached
    networks based on BSM traffic classes and performance goals; this is complementary
    to the previous recommendation and also necessary in interdomain communications."
