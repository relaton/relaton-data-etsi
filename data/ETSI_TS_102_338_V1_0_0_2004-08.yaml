  content: "In ITU-R WP8/A some proposal were made to update M.1073 related to GSM
    and its enhancements. No conclusion could be reached and advice from WP8/F was
    requested.\r\nFollowing discussion in ITU-R WP8/F, SDOs were requested to provide
    a specification to replace the current contents by referencing it in a manner
    similar to what is done in M.1457.\r\nIt is propose to elaborate a Technical Specification
    referencing existing material out of the 3GPP giving the full list of GSM specification
    by providing reference to the 21.101 and 141.101 respectively for Release 99 and
    later Releases."
