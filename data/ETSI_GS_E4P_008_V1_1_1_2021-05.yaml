abstract:
- content: This document specifies back-end mechanisms for Pandemic contact Tracing
    Systems, including architecture, information flow, protocols for sharing proximity
    data of contacts, data protection, user privacy, information security and the
    requisite APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Sufficient technical detail
    will be included to also facilitate means of interoperability in a later Work
    Item. Each system is characterized (e.g. in a table) by its degree of compatibility
    with the E4P requirements work item. The initial version of this document may
    be revised several times as additional methods are added, e.g. including methods
    which are gaining consensus in non-European countries.
