abstract:
- content: "This document identifies the various (historical) definitions and types
    and characteristics of Digital Twins (e.g. in areas of representing human actions,
    in health/biological areas, for smart manufacturing, etc) and considers the usage
    of the NGSI-LD information model and API for realising such systems. Special concern
    should be given to issues of privacy and leakage of data, depending on the use
    case and including the area of monitoring for handling pandemics.\r\n\r\nThe purpose
    of the document is to show to what extent various Digital Twin types can be realized
    or facilitated by NGSI-LD and to identify new features for NGSI-LD which would
    make it more useful for such areas of usage.\r\n\r\nThe document will identify
    from the SDO and research landscape a number of groups to contact for exchange
    of views. Contact with relevant ETSI groups such as SmartM2M, 3GPP, oneM2M, etc
    is expected.\r\n"
