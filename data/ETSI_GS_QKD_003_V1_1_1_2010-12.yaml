  content: This work item is a preparatory action for the definition of properties
    of components and internal interfaces of QKD Systems. Irrespective of the underlying
    technologies, there are certain devices that appear in most QKD Systems. These
    are e.g. quantum physical devices like photon sources and detectors, or classical
    equipment like protocol processing computer hardware and operating systems. For
    these components, relevant properties shall be identified that are to be subsequently
    subject to standardisation. Furthermore, a catalogue of relevant requirements
    for interfaces between components shall be established, to support the upcoming
    definition of internal interfaces.
