abstract:
- content: "This revision of ETSI GS NFV-SOL018 continues the development of the specification
    as part of the Release 4 and applies maintenance changes where applicable. This
    edition will add the profiling of the latest published version of the reference
    Kubernetes® API as NFV protocol and data model solution for the CIS MCCO (Managed
    CIS Cluster Object) and the CIS instance management service interfaces of the
    Container Infrastructure Service Management (CISM) function as specified in ETSI
    GS NFV-IFA 036. \r\n\r\nThe scope of the former Release 4 published edition is
    summarized herafter:\r\n\r\nThe work item will provide a mapping of the NFV object
    model for OS container management and orchestration to managed objects of Kubernetes®
    and Helm(TM) as specified by the CNCF® along with a specification of a mapping
    between a common set of input parameters (e.g., derived from VNFD/NSD and/or NFV-MANO
    RESTful APIs) and output parameters associated to the management and orchestration
    of the referred managed objects. It will profile the reference Kubernetes® API
    as NFV protocol and data model solution for OS container management and orchestration.
    It will profile the reference Helm(TM) documentation as NFV protocol and data
    model solution for management of OS container workload based on an MCIOP. It will
    profile the reference Docker(TM) registry API as NFV protocol and data model solution
    for OS container image management. The latest published versions of the reference
    Kubernetes® API, Helm(TM) documentation and Docker(TM) registry API are profiled
    against the requirements on the functions and the management service interfaces
    of the Container Infrastructure Service Management (CISM) and Container Image
    Registry (CIR) functions as specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040 and ETSI GS NFV-IFA
    010. The work item will include guidelines and rules on how the profiled and referenced
    solutions can be adopted in a way that facilitates their integration with NFV-MANO
    framework solutions. The resulting deliverable will contain normative provisions\r\n"
