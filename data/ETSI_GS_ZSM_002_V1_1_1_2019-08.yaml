abstract:
- content: "This work item specifies architectural principles, architectural requirements
    and an end-to-end abstract reference architecture for Zero-Touch Network and Service
    Management.  The reference architecture defines logical functional blocks and
    interfaces between the functional blocks.  The role and functionality of each
    logical functional block and the functionality of each interface (operations,
    information objects) are defined at a high level of abstraction.\r\nThe architecture
    supports the use cases and requirements defined by ISG ZSM. Procedures and detailed
    information models are beyond the scope of this work item."
