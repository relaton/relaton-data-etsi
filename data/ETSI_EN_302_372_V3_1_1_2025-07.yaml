  content: "This work item to amend the former version of EN 302 372 V2.1.1 is targeted
    to address the request of the EU desk officer. This includes a detailed description
    of the wanted performance criterion, RX-requirements and fixed limits for all
    requirements based on a clear test procedure. \r\nA first collection of open points
    which shall be considered (in addition) are uploaded as: ERMTGUWB(17)040005\r\nThe
    classification between the different use-case/wanted performance criterions/receiver
    requirements will be based on measurement distances of the TLPR sensor.\r\nThe
    systems operating based on regulation (and amendments): EC Decision 2013/752/EU
    and ERC Recommendation 70-03 Annex 6\r\n"
