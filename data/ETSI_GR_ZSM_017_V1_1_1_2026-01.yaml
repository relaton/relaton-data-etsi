abstract:
- content: 'The work item will document analysis of security risks related to closed-loop
    automation based on ETSI GS ZSM 009 series standards, ETSI GR ZSM 010 and ETSI
    GS ZSM 014 . Based on the analysis conducted, this work item will propose new
    security capabilities for the ZSM framework architecture to support the mitigation
    of relevant security risks, especially those applicable to the coordination across
    closed loops from different management domains under the ZSM framework. Recommendations
    for future normative work may be included in the study. '
