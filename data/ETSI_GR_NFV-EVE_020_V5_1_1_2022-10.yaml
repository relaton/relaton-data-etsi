abstract:
- content: This work item will study network function connectivity extensions scenarios,
    considering combination of computing and network integration for NFV. This will
    include the implementation of Dyncast at the NFVI level and the exposure, following
    a model-based approach of the infrastructure network, (e.g., focusing mainly on
    the extension of the information model of the Virtual Link and NFP). Extension
    of existing NFV templates to support and make use of the concept of extended network
    connectivity capabilities will be analysed as well (e.g., NSD, VNFD),  further
    exploring their impact on the NFV-MANO components.
