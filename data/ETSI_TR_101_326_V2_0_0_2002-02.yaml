abstract:
- content: "In telecommunication systems and therefore also in IP systems E.164 numbers
    (or dialled numbers related to E.164) are used by end users to identify the destination
    of a call.  In IP systems, when an end user is attached to a terminal, the E.164
    name of this end user is temporarily associated with the IP address (transport
    address) of the terminal (endpoint).  Private numbering schemes use similar arrangements.\r\nThis
    technical report defines the requirements for finding destinations (IP addresses
    of endpoints) on interconnected IP networks (systems) for calls originating on
    or transiting via IP telephony networks.  The final destination of the call may
    be either the IP network itself or on the SCN.  In this case the IP address needs
    to identify the POI to the SCN.\r\nAlthough the TR defines requirements for E.164
    numbers, the same principles could be applied to any new naming system that might
    be introduced for telephony.\r\nThe TR deals with obtaining IP-address (or Contact
    Addresses) for routing Call and Service Control Messages (including database queries)
    and Media Stream Packets.\r\nThe TR covers the requirements for calls to all types
    of number structures within E.164, national and private networks and includes
    the support of number portability, mobility and roaming."
