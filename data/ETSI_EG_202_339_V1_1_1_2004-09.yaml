  content: "This document defines requirements and recommendations on the Functional
    Architecture. It initially, focuses on the Signalling requirements for enhancement
    of the inter-network and international inter-connection of networks to allow the
    co-operation to achieve the support of Emergency services, e.g. IEPS. \r\nTwo
    steps are envisaged: Peer level gateway interconnection and inter-working via
    higher level functions, e.g. policy, status and user profile databases. Policing
    and Initialising of these services needs definition based on external end user
    requirements.\r\nThese capabilities are defined from benchmark scenarios, a number
    of which are included. \r\n"
