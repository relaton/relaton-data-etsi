abstract:
- content: "The scope of this ETSI Guide is to cover the standardisation of functions
    to allow lawful interception of services running in on IN platform. These functions
    probably need to be defined in the SSP anc SCP, including the information flox
    between these entities. Alternatives will, however, be investigated. As specific
    parts of the information flow are confidential, security aspects need to be addressed.\r\n\r\nReference
    documents: ETR 330, ETR 331, ES 201 158."
