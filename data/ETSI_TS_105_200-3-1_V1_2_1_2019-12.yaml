  content: "The reporting of Global KPIs in accordance with EN 305 200-3-1 requires
    the collection of data to enable the calculation of the following aspects \r\n-
    Objective KPI relating to the total energy consumption (KPIEC); \r\n- Objective
    KPI relating to the use of energy performance (KPIEP) which combines KPIEC with
    other measurements of energy consumption to provide Objective KPIs related to
    task efficiency (KPITE), the reuse of energy (KPIREUSE) and the use of renewable
    energy (KPIREN). \r\n The present document supports the requirements of EN 305
    200-3-1 providing a framework for, and detailing, the implementation procedures
    including any necessary techniques for estimation of energy consumption together
    with constants to be employed for weighting and banding purposes."
