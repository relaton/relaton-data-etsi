abstract:
- content: "This TR maps the commercial use cases and requirements from the Commercial
    Requirements for DVB-I service support over 5G networks and systems of DVB Bluebook
    C100 into deployment guidelines.\r\nThe TR includes high level summaries of DVB-I
    over 5G commercial requirements, DVB technologies such as DVB-I, DVB-DASH, DVB-NIP,
    DVB-MABR and DVB Codecs, 3GPP technologies such as the 5G System, 5G Media Streaming
    and eMBMS, ETSI JTC Broadcast Technology such as LTE-Based 5G Broadcast and 5G-MAG
    Reference Tools.\r\nEach service scenario architecture and workflows are detailed
    in reference to relevant specifications. Gaps identified in existing specifications
    are identified and are documented as recommendations to the relevant organization
    i.e. DVB, 3GPP or ETSI.\r\nThis work is the result of the DVB and 5G-MAG Joint
    task force on DVB-I over 5G."
