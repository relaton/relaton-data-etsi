  content: "Technical charcteristics which shall be provided by terminal equipment\r\nwhich
    is capable of connection to a public telecommunications network\r\n(1) and which
    uses DECT cordless communications. These requirements\r\nshall apply to DECT equipment
    providing any telephony application.\r\nThe cordless transmission of such terminal
    equipment operate within\r\nthe frequency band 1880-1900 MHz.\r\nIt shall apply
    in addition to the attachment requirements for the\r\nappropriate public network;
    and in addition to the CTRs for DECT\r\nGeneral attachment requirement for telephony
    applications.\r\n DECT comprises two equipment elements referred to as Fixed Part
    (FP)\r\nand Portable Part (PP).\r\n The objective of this document is to ensure
    the air interface\r\ninteroperability of DECT equipment capable of telephony applications,\r\nin
    such a way that any DECT FP conforming to the procedures\r\ndescribed in this
    document shall be capable of interoperability\r\nwith any DECT PP conforming to
    the procedures described in\r\nthis document.\r\n The FP and/or the PP shall conform
    to the requirements and tests in\r\nthis document. This document is structured
    to allow type approval of\r\nthe FP and PP as separate items. Where the DECT FP
    is connected\r\nto a PSTN, and where there are specific national variations in
    the\r\nrequirements for voice telephony, these shall be accomodated\r\nwithin
    the FP so that the PP shall be common.\r\n (1) Note 1: CTR for basic rate ISDN,
    CTR for primary rate ISDN, or\r\nnational regulations (implementing  ETS 300 001)
    for PSTN.\r\nInteconnection of DECT terminals to the GSM network is still under\r\nstudy;
    in due course, the scope statement may need amending to\r\nreflect this point.\r\nNote
    2: It is expected that this document will be based on the radio\r\nand protocol
    provisions of ETS 300 175\r\n"
