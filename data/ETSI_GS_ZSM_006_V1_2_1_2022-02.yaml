  content: "This new edition of the PoC framework (v1.2.1) will update the PoC acceptance
    criteria to make it easier for a PoC team to be formed, and thus increase PoC
    submissions.\r\n\r\nThe PoC framework defines a framework to be used by ETSI ISG
    ZSM to coordinate and promote multi stakeholder Proofs of Concept (PoC) projects
    illustrating key aspects of ZSM. \r\nThe main objectives of the ZSM PoC framework
    are:\r\n to ensure the PoC projects are scoped around relevant topics for ISG
    ZSM that require from-the-field input;\r\n to ensure that the PoC results, lessons
    learnt and identified gaps are feedback to ISG ZSM;\r\n to build confidence on
    the viability of ZSM;\r\n to encourage the development of a diverse and open ecosystem
    by fostering the integration of components from different players;\r\n to support
    standardization and industry promotion activities of ISG ZSM.\r\nThe framework
    describes:\r\n The different roles and responsibilities in the PoC activity process.\r\n
    The PoC activity process.\r\n The acceptance criteria for PoC proposals and reports.\r\n"
