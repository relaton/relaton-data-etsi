  content: "This ETR describes the results of the studies of the use of\r\nsingle-mode
    fibre in the access network, referred to in this report\r\nas the Optical Access
    Network (OAN). It has identified a number of\r\nfunctions that are required and
    has begun to list those functions\r\nthat require to be studied. There may even
    be a requirement not to\r\ndefine (standardize) some of the functions identified.
    Where it has\r\nbeen possible to provide a definition in suitable text for a\r\nfunction,
    it is given in this report. However where a definition\r\nrequires further study,
    this is indicated accordingly.\r\nAs this network may carry analogue and digital
    signals, this ETR\r\ndescribes the characteristics of an access network using
    monomode\r\nfibre (single mode) between the user network and the local exchange,\r\nor
    head end, that allows evolution from the Plain Old Telephony\r\nService (POTS)
    and similar bearer services to the Broadband\r\nIntegrated Services Digital Network
    (B-ISDN) bearer service without\r\nthe requirement to re-cable the installed fibre
    access.\r\nIt has also been identified that there may be studies in other\r\nstandardisation
    bodies that could have an impact on the requirements\r\nof the access network.
    As there has not been any input from these\r\nbodies at this time, their requirements
    have not been considered.\r\n [conversion of TM-TR 002 to ETR for referential
    purposes]\r\n  "
