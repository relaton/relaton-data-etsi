abstract:
- content: "The work item shall report on the steps required to cover the requirements
    of the Data Retention (DR) directive for all of NGN-R2.The report is expected
    to identify an architecture for DR in an NGN that covers the following:\r\n·Identify
    the Points of Retention (PoR) in an NGN;\r\n·Identify the Points of Archive and
    Retrieval (PoAaR) in an NGN;\r\n·Identify the data to be retained at each PoR;\r\n·Identify
    the transfer from PoRs to Points of Archive and Retrieval (PoAaR);\r\n·To identify
    the security requirements for PoRs and PoAaRs including the requirements for security
    of transfers between them;\r\n·To identify the future standardisation work.\r\n
    The scope shall not extend to the handover domain (responsibility of TC LI) but
    shall consider the multi-vendor, multi-provider, aspects of DR in an NGN. Aspects
    relating to common IMS shall not be covered but if identified shall be transferred
    to the responsibility of 3GPP."
