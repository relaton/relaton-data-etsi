abstract:
- content: "The focus of the present document  is on PSI/SI tables and descriptors
    used in IPDC in DVB-H Systems.\r\nTables and descriptors are introduced, and their
    usage is described.\r\nThe document defines the set of PSI/SI data an IPDC DVB-H
    Receiver may expect to be available on an IPDC DVB-H Bearer (data transmission
    baseband) and the IPDC DVB-H Network is expected to make available on the IPDC
    DVB-H Bearer.\r\nThe scope of this “PSI/SI for IPDC in DVB-H Systems” is to support
    coherent and interoperable signalling on data link layer on all IPDC DVB-H Networks\r\nThis
    document draws from a number of existing specifications listed in clause 2. In
    case of ambiguity these original documents shall be considered as authoritative"
