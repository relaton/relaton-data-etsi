abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies how to create a broadcast carousel of objects
    for an audio information service. TopNews allows a service provider to deliver
    compressed audio, for instance MP3, content via digital radio. Receivers may then
    extract information directly from this carousel and store it in the receiver in
    order to present the service. To simplify the delivery of additional text and
    image files TopNews is designed as a profile of the Broadcast Website user application.\r\n"
