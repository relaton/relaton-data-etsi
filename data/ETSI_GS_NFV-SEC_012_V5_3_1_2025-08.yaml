  content: The present document defines requirements for host system elements on which
    sensitive workloads are to be run. The present document defines requirements to
    ensure isolation of sensitive workloads from non-sensitive workloads sharing a
    platform. The present document discusses a wide range of different technologies
    which aim to increase the security of a host system for the workloads which will
    be executing on it. In this latest revision cryptographic primitives and guidance
    has been changed bring the document up to date.
