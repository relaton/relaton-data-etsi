abstract:
- content: The purpose of this work item is to prepare the requirements for communications
    involving IoT devices in all types of emergency situations (e.g. communications
    of individuals with authorities/organisations, between authorities/organisations,
    from authorities/organisations to the individuals, amongst individuals). The work
    will start with a study of the state of the art across the IoT domain scope. It
    will include an analysis of use cases for emergency services, taking into account
    the work already done in other projects, such as oneM2M and 3GPP. It will conclude
    with an analysis of the impacts of these use cases on the existing specifications
    and of what needs to be standardized.
