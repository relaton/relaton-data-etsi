  content: This work item highlights and describes the current challenges related
    to data storage and ledger operations when the PDL nodes are offline (duty cycled
    or truly offline); the methodologies and techniques that can be applied to Smart
    Contracts to operate when the nodes are offline and develop secure interim storage
    and negotiation algorithms that ensure the integrity of the data feed to the PDLs.
