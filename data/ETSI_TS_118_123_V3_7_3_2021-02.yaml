abstract:
- content: "This Work Item is intended to examine how the release 1 oneM2M System
    can be used in the home vertical domain and discover and/or study advanced features
    which the next oneM2M release(s) could support. To this end, starting from collecting
    new home domain use cases with potential requirements, including those provided
    by related PT2s, i.e. smart home-related groups such as HGI and BBF, the collected
    home domain use cases will be analysed to investigate if the release 1 oneM2M
    System needs to be enhanced in architecture, security, semantics and management
    areas. Additionally, through this process, this Work Item is intended to derive
    missing requirements for the next oneM2M release(s) and the enhanced features
    from the derived requirements which enable the oneM2M features in the home vertical
    domain.\r\nIn addition to the study of the Home Domain provided by TR-0013, this
    Work Item intends to develop an additional Technical Report (Home Domain Abstract
    Information Model) that defines an Abstract Information Model for the Home Domain
    Uses Cases. The definition of the Abstract Information Model will be based on
    Data Models that currently exist in the Home Domain. The Home Domain Abstract
    Information Model does not intend to define the Interworking function between
    the oneM2M System and protocols of the Data Models from which the Abstract Data
    Model is defined. The Home Domain Abstract Information Model Technical Report
    also intends to define how the developed Abstract Information Model for a device
    could be represented in the CSEs of the oneM2M System.\r\nBased on previously
    mentioned studies, this Work Item will provide normative parts, via CRs to existing
    TS and via a new TS dedicated to information model. The new TS includes oneM2M
    defined information model, which can be the new one or adoption of the existing
    one, for home appliances and the mapping with other information models from external
    organizations. The information model will be mapped to oneM2M resource(s).\r\n"
