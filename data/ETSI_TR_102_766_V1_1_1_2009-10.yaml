  content: " Define a GRID testing working framework (tests and validation methodologies,
    approach and tools to be used. By example, propose to re-use the tools developed
    by MTS-IPT  to create easily a Requirement Catalogue able to transform existing
    ICT GRID specifications into tests requirements standards corresponding to selected
    GRID interoperability case studies. In both the IT sectors and in the Telecom
    world, produce the best practices to obtain ICT Interoperability.  List and compile
    existing GRID interoperability solutions including in particular: interoperability
    events, state of the Art papers, guidelines, interoperability profiles, reference
    implementations, use cases, test suites, test beds, testing tools, benchmarking
    existing in ICT including NGN, IPv6 and open source developments."
