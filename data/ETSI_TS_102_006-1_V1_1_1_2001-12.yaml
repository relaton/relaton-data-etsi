abstract:
- content: "In order to guarantee the functionality of a receiver as well as increasing
    its functionality once deployed in the field a software update service is required.
    This document specifies a standard mechanism for\r\nsignalling a software update
    service and the means to carry the data for such a software update service. This
    document does not define the mandatory character of this protocol in a specific
    context, and it does not exclude the use of proprietary mechanisms for doing a
    software update. This allows a network to support horizontal market model receivers
    (e.g. MHP receivers). Equally it allows receivers requiring a software update
    service to be deployed in a network independent way.\r\n"
