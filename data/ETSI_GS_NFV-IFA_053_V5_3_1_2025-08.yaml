  content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 053 continues the development of the specification
    as part of the NFV Release 5. This edition will add requirements to support the
    Release 5 features. The scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-IFA
    053 analyses architectural options for physical infrastructure management in an
    NFV environment and evaluates existing solutions like IPMI, Ansible, DMTF Redfish,
    OpenStack Ironic, LFN ODIM and metal3 to prepare profiling of de-facto standards.\r\nThe
    work item specifies requirements and provides an abstract information model for
    describing the physical resources in the NFVI. The work item also specifies interface
    specifications related to managing physical infrastructure with respect to life
    cycle, inventory, configuration, topology and FM/PM of physical compute/storage/networking
    resources, including new types of physical resources.\r\nThe work item includes
    an informative study part as well as normative provisions.\r\n"
