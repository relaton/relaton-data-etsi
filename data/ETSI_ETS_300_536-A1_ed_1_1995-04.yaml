abstract:
- content: "REASON 1:\r\nTo enable the SC to discard duplicate SMs.\r\n CONSEQUENCES
    OF NON-ACCEPTANCE 1:\r\nSM duplication may in certain cases cause severe inconvenience
    to SMS\r\nusers.\r\nREASON 2:\r\nA number of situations can occur at the Visited
    MSC whereby an SM\r\ndelivery attempt to an MS can fail due to congestion. The
    current\r\nerror cause - system failure - is inappropriate.\r\n CONSEQUENCES OF
    NON-ACCEPTANCE 2:\r\nThe SC is unable to distinguish between \"congestion\" and
    \"system\r\nfailure\" and therefore cannot take action which would be more\r\nappropriate
    to a congestion situation.\r\n  "
