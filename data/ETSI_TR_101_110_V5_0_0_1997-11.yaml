  content: "This report gives some guidelines to implement test methods and to evaluate
    the transmission quality of handsfree Mobile Stations (MSs. The normative characteristics
    and test methods for handsfree Mobile Stations (MSs are defined in ETS 300 903
    (GSM 03.50). This Technical Report gives additional data.\r\nIt includes summaries
    of texts or contributions presented and discussed during the meetings of ad hoc
    group SMG2/03.50 on environmental conditions, speech processing and quality assessment
    for handsfree Mobile Station.\r\nThe items covered by this report are mainly\r\n-Environmental
    conditions for handsfree mobile stations\r\n-Speech processing techniques and
    consequences on delay\r\n-Speech quality assessment for handsfree implementing
    acoustic echo cancellation and noise reduction\r\n\r\n"
