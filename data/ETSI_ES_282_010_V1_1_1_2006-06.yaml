  content: "This  WI deals with charging and starts with a gap analysis of the 3GPP
    charging architecture document ( TS 32.240) in order to  identify NGN entities
    that need to generate raw charging data.. This analysis  may lead to an endorsement
    of 32.240 and later endorsement of TS 32 260, TS 32 298, TS 32 299. The work will
    identify subjects of impact to TISPAN and identify first priority subjects to
    deal with in the scope of R1 \r\nA review of TS 22 115 will also be done as part
    of the process and any results will be communicated with WG1."
