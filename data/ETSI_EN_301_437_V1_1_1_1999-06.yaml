  content: "This EN (harmonised standard) specifies the technical characteristics
    (electrical and mechanical interface requirements and access protocol) under Articles
    4(d) and 4(f) of Directive 91/263/EEC to be provided by a single terminal equipment
    which is intended (a) for pan-European approval and (b) for connection by two
    wires to an analogue interface of the PSTN.  \r\nThis interface is characterized
    by d.c. loop seizure and clearing, uses low frequency a.c. ringing below the speech
    passband to indicate an incoming call and in the transmission phase has an approximate
    bandwidth of 3kHz at the network termination point, \r\nand (c) for supporting
    any telephony service.\r\n"
