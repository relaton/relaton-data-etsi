abstract:
- content: "This Global System for Mobile communications Technical Specification (\r\nGTS)
    provides a study which proves the feasibility of ISDN-based DECT/\r\nGSM interworking
    to support roaming of users of cordless DECT terminal\r\ns between public GSM
    networks and private DECT networks via an ISDN-ba\r\nsed interface. The study
    is aiming at teleservice speech and supplemen\r\ntary services. Data, fax and
    other teleservices are out of scope. In o\r\nrder to limit the amount of work
    for subsequent specifications to what\r\nis achievable within a reasonable timeframe,
    this feasibility study c\r\nonsiders very complex functionality, e.g. inter-network
    handover, to b\r\ne out of scope. Commercial viability and demand has to be considered
    b\r\ny GSM MoU Association.\r\n "
