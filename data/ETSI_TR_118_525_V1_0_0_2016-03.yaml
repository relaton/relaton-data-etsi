abstract:
- content: "The present Work Item proposes a guideline for application developers
    who want to use functionalities offered by an oneM2M service platform.\r\n\r\nWhen
    implementing a standard, it is frequently requested from software developer community
    to get some tutorials describing for basic use cases, some procedures and scenarios,
    including diagrams, message flows, message traces samples, resource description
    samples, etc.. â€¦ Such document would be helpful in software development to provide
    overall understanding of the main functions offered by the oneM2M architecture,
    before going more deeply into the analysis of the oneM2M standards."
