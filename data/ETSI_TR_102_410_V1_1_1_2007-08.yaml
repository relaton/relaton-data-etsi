  content: 'In case of an unforeseen disaster, citizens may have a strong demand to
    communicate among themselves in order to: a) coordinate actions of mutual interest,
    b) ascertain/learn the state of relatives, property, etc. This document tries
    to establish, a minimum set of requirements to be set to communications facilities
    under such circumstances, taking into consideration that the normal infrastructure
    of country or region in question may be in a very bad state. The document gives
    recommendations on basic facilities that should be catered for and hints at possible
    realisation.'
