  content: "Studies have shown that Hearing impaired people are suffering of insufficient
    intelligibility of transmitted speech, due to background noises, transmission
    impairments,  shapes of receivers, tandemming of speech processing and coupling
    between earphones and hearing aids. It has also been seen that wideband bandwidth
    provides improved quality than achieved with narrowband for hearing impaired people
    using hearing aids, cochlear implants. \r\nThe work item  is intended to define
    requirements and measurement methods for\r\n-\tImproved listening quality for
    hearing impaired people, with or without hearing devices (including loudness,
    equalization,)\r\n-\tImpact of the different transmission impairments on intelligibility
    and definition of a model to assess objectively speech intelligibility\r\nThe
    impairments from the distant send side may also have impacts on intelligibility
    \ of received speech, needing performance improvements.\r\n The work item will
    define scenarios in orde rto conduct subjective tests on intelligibility for hearing
    impaired people and is intended to define and validate an objective model to predict
    speech intelligibility. \r\n"
