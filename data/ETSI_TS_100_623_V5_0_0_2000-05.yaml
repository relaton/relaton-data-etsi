abstract:
- content: "This specification addresses the network\r\nmanagement messages and procedures
    across the A-bis interface, which\r\nis defined as Qx in GSM. The information
    model included here defines\r\nthe objects and how they are addressed for purposes
    of operations and\r\nmaintenance activities.\r\nThere is a requirement for the
    A-bis interface to be open to allow\r\ninteroperation between BTSs of different
    manufacturers working to the\r\nsame BSC. This ETS addresses this requirement
    from O&M point of view,\r\nwhich allows this interworking to take place. It shows
    the split of NM\r\nfunctions between BSC and BTS. The procedures and coding of
    the\r\nmessages are specified in detail. In practice, in addition to this ETS\r\nit
    is necessary that the content of manufacturer-dependent information\r\nfields
    be specified to fulfill the functionality.\r\nIt is essential for operation that
    a BSC can handle the functions used\r\nby all its BTSs. Therefore, all items in
    this ETS are considered\r\nmandatory unless otherwise indicated in this ETS.\r\n"
