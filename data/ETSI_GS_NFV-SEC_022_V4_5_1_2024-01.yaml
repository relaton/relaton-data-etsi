abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-SEC 022 propagates the deliverable into NFV Release
    4. This edition will add requirements to support Release 3 and Release 4 features
    (listed in the Release 3 and 4 Descriptions) and will extend the scope of the
    former Release 2 edition summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-SEC 022 defines the
    access tokens and related metadata for RESTful protocols and data model for ETSI
    NFV management and orchestration (MANO) interfaces. It defines also the process
    for the token verification by the API Producer. For this aim, the document:\r\n-
    Analyses the security threat arising from the misuse of the access token and defines
    the security requirements associated to access token.\r\n- Analyses existing specifications
    related to access token for API access and their compliancy with the requirements
    defined.\r\n- Defines the token request and generation profile, the token format
    and associated metadata considering the result of existing access token specifications
    analysis.\r\n- Defines the token verification procedures for the API Producer.\r\n"
