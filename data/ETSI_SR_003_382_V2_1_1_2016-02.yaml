  content: "The work done in CSC Phase 1 did not address the relationship with Open
    Source. However, Open Source is an important contributing element to Cloud Computing
    and participants to CSC Phase 1 have considered it essential to understand what
    the relationship can be between Open Source and standards and vice-versa. The
    work will consist in particular in an inventory of the on-going Open Source projects
    that have an established relationship with one or more of the standards organizations
    identified during CSC Phase 1, and an analysis of their potential contribution
    to standards.\r\n\r\nThe main deliverable will be a specific document/report defining
    how standards and Open Source are interworking in the field of Cloud Computing,
    outline the Open Source results of interest for standardisation and identify additional
    challenges."
