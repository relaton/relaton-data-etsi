  content: "The present document is applicable to an analogue presented interface
    intended to deliver 3,1 kHz voiceband services which terminates a Public Switched
    Telephone Network (PSTN) with 2-wire local loops. The signal is digitally encoded
    on the network side of the interface, but the technology is not specified. The
    present document applies to interfaces where any terminal equipment (TE) connected
    to the interface is connected via a cable with a maximum loop resistance of 30
    ohm.\r\nNOTE:This is equivalent to approximately 170 metres of cable with 0,5
    mm diameter copper conductors. See figure 1 for clarity.\r\nThe objective of the
    present document is to specify the physical and electrical characteristics at
    an analogue interface. The present document specifies characteristics of the interface
    to enable it to operate with most existing national PSTN TE, and especially with
    PSTN TE designed according to the European standards for analogue presented TEs.\r\nThe
    electrical conditions specified for the interface are sufficient to ensure satisfactory
    operation of the following functions of TE:\r\na)call control;\r\nb)transmission;\r\nc)dialling;\r\nd)ringing."
