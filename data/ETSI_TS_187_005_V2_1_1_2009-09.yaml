abstract:
- content: The work item shall cover the interception domain for all of NGN-R2 to
    a detailed stage 2 level (including the definition of information flow content
    at the point of interception). The scope shall not extend to the handover domain
    (responsibility of TC LI) but shall consider the multi-vendor, multi-provider,
    aspects of interception in an NGN. Aspects relating to common IMS shall not be
    covered but if identified shall be transferred to the responsibility of 3GPP SA3-LI
