abstract:
- content: "Specification of a Safety Extra Low Voltage DC power supply unit for powering
    at home or in public area (stores, hotels, railway stations, etc.) any ICT devices
    equipped with DC input. Many items should be defined:\r\n-\t the voltage interface
    between 12 to 60 VDC\r\n-\tthe architecture: how many outputs or a DC network,
    area (room, zone)\r\n-\tthe need of configurable outputs\r\n-\tthe efficiency,
    reliability, EMC and resistibility\r\n-\tit should enable standalone power of
    ICTâ€™s in case of big failures or crisis (electric grid failure, climatic crisis,
    earthquake, etc.) \r\n-\trenewable energy use especially in emerging countries
    with no grid or of poor quality grid: which input interface, how to make the sizing
    ?\r\n-\tit may offer other functions than ICT such as low power light which highly
    increases life quality and sustainable development,\r\n-\tproduct safety according
    IEC or CENELEC (EN 60950-1, EN 62368-1 ed2)\r\n-\tecodesign\r\nThis specification
    should take into account ETSI TS 102874-x and works of HGI, ITU-T SG5/3  in L.adapter
    phase2, DC Emerge Alliance, UPAMD and IEC TC100 on ICT device powering, etc. \r\n\r\nSome
    Interests and Benefits :\r\nCompatibility with renewable energy and alternative
    energy referenced in ETSI EE TR 102 532 \r\nOptimize efficiency cost by mutualising
    several devices on the same DC power system\r\nCompatibility of this short distance
    low voltage network with future building using 400Vdc\r\nIntegrated power shutdown
    management, to save energy as much as possible"
