  content: "Analogue and Digital PMR446 Equipment.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the following
    issues should be taken into account, as appropriate, in the review of the applicable
    standard(s):\r\n\tPMR 446 equipment is hand portable (no base station or repeater
    use), for short range peer to peer mode, and uses integral antennas only;\r\n\tThe
    band 446.0-446.2 MHz is designated for the use of analogue PMR 446 with a channel
    plan based on 12.5 kHz spacing where the lowest carrier frequency is 446.00625
    MHz;\r\n\tThe band 446.1-446.2 MHz is designated for the use of digital PMR 446
    with a channel plan based on 6.25 kHz and 12.5 kHz spacing where the lowest carrier
    frequencies are 446.103125 MHz and 446.10625 MHz respectively;\r\n\tThe band 446.0-446.2
    MHz is designated for the use of digital PMR 446 with a channel plan based on
    6.25 kHz and 12.5 kHz spacing where the lowest carrier frequencies are 446.003125
    MHz and 446.00625 MHz respectively as of 1 January 2018;\r\n\tAnalogue PMR446
    equipment operating in the frequency range 446.1-446.2 MHz should use more robust
    receivers as specified in ETSI TS 103 236 or equivalent technical specifications;\r\n\tAnalogue
    PMR446 equipment operating in the frequency range 446.0-446.1 MHz should use more
    robust receivers as specified in ETSI TS 103 236 or equivalent technical specifications
    when placed on the market as of 1 January 2017;\r\n\tThe effective radiated power
    shall not exceed 500 mW;\r\n\tAll PMR 446 radio equipment shall have reception
    capability;\r\n\tPMR 446 radio equipment having Push-To-Talk (PTT) functionality
    capable of being latched on shall apply a 180 seconds maximum transmitter time-out;\r\n\tPMR
    446 radio equipment having no Push-To-Talk (PTT) functionality shall apply a 180
    seconds maximum transmitter time-out and VOX (Voice activation exchange) control;\r\n\tThe
    following definitions apply:\r\no\t Integral antenna: antenna designed as a fixed
    part of the equipment (without the use of an external connector) which cannot
    be disconnected from the equipment by a user with the intent to connect another
    antenna;\r\no\tHand portable station: equipment fitted with an integral antenna,
    normally used on a stand-alone basis, to be carried on a person or held in the
    hand.\r\n"
