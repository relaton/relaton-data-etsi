abstract:
- content: "The objective of this work is to develop a TS that specifies European
    performance requirements for multi-mode xDSL transceivers. \r\nA multi-mode transceiver
    is a device capable of supporting multiple xDSL technologies (e.g. ADSL2plus,
    ADSl2, ADSL and VDSL2) and applies to both network and customer equipment.\r\nIt
    is proposed that the new TS should address the following issues:\r\n·Performance
    of a multi-mode transceiver compared with that of a single-mode transceiver\r\n·Power
    consumption of a multi-mode transceiver compared with that of a single-mode transceiver\r\n·Performance
    of cabinet-based multi-mode transceivers\r\n·Power consumption of cabinet-based
    multi-mode transceivers\r\n·Performance of exchange-based multi-mode transceivers\r\nPower
    consumption limits for Broadband systems are currently defined in the EU Code
    of Conduct.  \r\nLiaison and cooperation with other competent Standards bodies
    (specifically ETSI EE, ITU-T Q4/15 and Broadband Forum)."
