  script: Latn
  content: "The objective of this work is to develop a TS that specifies European
    performance requirements for multi-mode xDSL transceivers. \r\nA multi-mode transceiver
    is a device capable of supporting multiple xDSL technologies (e.g. ADSL2plus,
    ADSl2, ADSL and VDSL2) and applies to both network and customer equipment.\r\nIt
    is proposed that the new TS should address the following issues:\r\nPerformance
    of a multi-mode transceiver compared with that of a single-mode transceiver\r\nPower
    consumption of a multi-mode transceiver compared with that of a single-mode transceiver\r\nPerformance
    of cabinet-based multi-mode transceivers\r\nPower consumption of cabinet-based
    multi-mode transceivers\r\nPerformance of exchange-based multi-mode transceivers\r\nPower
    consumption limits for Broadband systems are currently defined in the EU Code
    of Conduct.  \r\nLiaison and cooperation with other competent Standards bodies
    (specifically ETSI EE, ITU-T Q4/15 and Broadband Forum)."
