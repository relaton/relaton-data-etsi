  content: This new Work Item focuses on creating a feasibility study and a related
    technical report that will address the different technical possibilities for local
    high-quality wireless networks (nomadic or fixed) to access spectrum temporarily
    on a shared basis. Application domains envisaged for such networks are typically
    deployed by vertical industries (e.g. Creative- and Culture Industries, eHealth,
    Factory and Process Automation, Public Safety) stipulating demanding QoS requirements
    (availability, reliability and latency) for wireless communication. The technical
    report will document high-level use cases, review the feasibility of existing
    spectrum sharing frameworks, and if required propose evolved, extended or new
    technical solutions for spectrum sharing, and network architectures addressing
    different network topologies and device types. This includes systems using spectrum
    access grants for operation under certain restrictions , e.g. spectrum availability
    duration or (geo-)location.  The objective is to identify whether current sharing
    frameworks, e.g. Licensed Shared Access, Spectrum Access System, etc., are appropriate
    for localized, high-QoS systems and to identify possible enhancements and/or alternatives
    on the technical solutions as appropriate.
