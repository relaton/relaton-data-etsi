  content: "This report develops a security gap and threat analysis and is identifying
    means to mitigate threats to F5G. \r\nThis work includes the identification of
    architectural and functional components to be added in F5G as well as additional
    core requirements and extensions to the F5G architecture to enable and manage
    mitigations. \r\nThe work item identifies threats, threat agents, weaknesses,
    and vulnerabilities in F5G and recommend the provision of functional and architectural
    components to mitigate risk.\r\nThe specification addressing security mitigation
    is part of a future work. \r\n\r\nThe exchange of information and the cooperation
    with TC Cyber will be fundamental. "
