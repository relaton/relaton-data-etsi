abstract:
- content: "In order to test (in a given environment) the emergency call/messaging
    capability of the current operator it would be favourable to have a test procedure,
    i.e. to be able to call  \"test\" address not invoking a real emergency call.
    \ Such a test could be invoked either manually or automatically (with a given
    periodicity, or when the end-user has moved). Care must be taken with respect
    to security and network overload. It should work both for calls from CS and PS
    networks.\r\nThe aim is to investigate this matter and produce a overall functional
    architecture and specification for such a service. \r\nA list of possible directory
    number/access codes to invoke the service might also be proposed."
