  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) provides the management\r\ninformation
    model for the Configuration and Fault Management aspects\r\nof the GSM Base Station
    System (BSS) Network Element as seen on the Q3\r\ninterface between the OS (e.g.
    OMC) and the BSS.\r\nThe information defined in this model is that which is required
    to\r\nmanage the BSS Network Element as set forth in the GSM core\r\nspecifications
    for telecommunications operation, and as specified in\r\nthe GSM 12-series Specifications
    for management requirements. The\r\nmanagement information defined in this ETS
    is primarily related to\r\nwhat is termed configuration and fault management within
    the CCITT\r\nX.701 [7] definition of Management Functional Areas. Additional\r\nmanagement
    information elements of the BSS model for other management\r\nareas are defined
    in other GSM 12-series Specifications. For example,\r\nthe management information
    related to the performance Management\r\nFunctional Area is to be found in GSM
    12.04 [27]. See GSM 12.00 [24]\r\nfor a complete overview of the GSM 12-series
    specifications.\r\nIn addition to the formal GDMO definitions, additional information
    is\r\nincluded to aid in understanding the model and its elements. Summary\r\ndescriptions,
    containment and inheritance diagrams, and entity\r\nrelationship diagrams are
    provided for this purpose.\r\nThe general management information contained in
    the models specified\r\nin CCITT M.3100 [3] and CCITT X.7xx Recommendations is
    referenced in\r\nthis ETS but the formal definitions are contained in the referenced\r\ndocuments.\r\n"
