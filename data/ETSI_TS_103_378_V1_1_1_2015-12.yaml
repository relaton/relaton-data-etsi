abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies and formalizes SmartBAN unified data representation
    formats, semantic open data model and corresponding ontology. \r\nThe present
    document is applicable to a BAN and/or a Smart BAN comprising wearable sensors/actuators
    devices, a relay/coordinator device and a Hub. The relay/Coordinator and the Hub
    functionalities may be handled by a single device or by two distinct devices.\r\nThe
    present document will in particular define a unified description model with an
    extensible semantic metadata for Smart BAN entities and related data (including
    in particular sensor/actuator/relay/coordinator/Hub descriptions and sensed/measured
    data), as well as for key monitoring and control information.\r\nThe present document
    does not address the specification and the formalization of the SmartBAN service
    ontology and associated enablers. This will be addressed in later dedicated Work
    Item of TC SmartBAN."
