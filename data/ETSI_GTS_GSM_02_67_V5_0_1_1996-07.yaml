  content: "This GSM Technical Specification (GTS) specifies the stage 1\r\ndescription
    of the enhanced Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-emption\r\nService (eMLPP). This
    service has two parts - precedence and pre\r\nemption. Precedence involves assigning
    a priority level to a call in\r\ncombination with fast call set-up. Pre-emption
    involves the seizing of\r\nresources, which are in use by a call of a lower precedence,
    by a\r\nhigher level precedence call in the absence of idle resources.\r\nPre-emption
    can also involve the disconnection of an on-going call of\r\nlower precedence
    to accept an incoming call of higher precedence.\r\nThe eMLPP service is provided
    as a network operator s option to a\r\ndomain of a network. The domain can be
    the whole network or a subset\r\nof the network. The eMLPP service applies to
    all network resources in\r\nthe domain that is in common use. The eMLPP service
    is applicable to\r\nall mobile stations in the domain with all or some mobile
    stations\r\nhaving a respective subscription assigning precedence according to
    the\r\neMLPP service.\r\neMLPP is a supplementary service and shall be provided
    to a subscriber\r\nfor all basic services subscribed to and for which eMLPP applies.\r\nNOTE:\tIt
    is under study whether normal GSM phase 2 mobile stations\r\nwill be able to be
    used for this service.\r\nThe service is described from the service subscriber
    s and user s\r\npoint of view, in particular:\r\n-\tthe procedure for normal operation
    with successful outcome;\r\n -\tthe action to be taken in exceptional circumstances;\r\n
    -\tthe interaction with other GSM services and features.\r\n This specification
    does not deal with the Man-Machine Interface (MMI)\r\nrequirements, but makes
    reference to the appropriate Global System for\r\nMobile communications (GSM)
    specifications.\r\nThis specification is applicable to teleseruices 1x and 6x
    and to all\r\nbearer services used in a mobile network according to the digital\r\ncellular
    telecommunications system GSM if eMLPP is provided. Any\r\ninteraction with other
    services and/or networks not dealt with in\r\nclauses 8 or 9 are outside the scope
    of this specification.\r\n  "
