abstract:
- content: "A proposed TR to describe the following:\r\n\r\nAn approach to encourage
    development and adoption of 'secure by default' platform security technologies
    by showing how they can be used to effectively solve real business problems, and
    improve the usability of secure services.\r\n\r\nThe intended audience is decision
    makers rather than engineering teams.  These could be deciding which features
    to include in a new platform, or which are required as part of a procurement activity.\r\n\r\nWe
    will first produce a structure for describing identified business requirements/issues
    for a particular set of users; detailing the characteristics required of possible
    solutions, and finally identifying existing or emerging standards which provide
    those characteristics. The last two activities require technical expertise, hence
    the production of this TR within TC-CYBER.\r\n\r\nA particular example is to identify
    challenges relating to end user devices for large organisations.  Currently adoption
    of device hardware security features is low, despite widespread agreement within
    the technical community that they are needed.  This example will aim to show that
    a market for these features does exist, and that a strong case can be made for
    organisations to actively seek them out."
