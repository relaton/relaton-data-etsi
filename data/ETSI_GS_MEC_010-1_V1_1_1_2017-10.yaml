  content: This work item focuses on the management of the mobile edge system, mobile
    edge hosts and mobile edge platforms. This includes platform configuration, performance
    and fault management, application monitoring, remote service configuration and
    service control, information gathering regarding the platform features, available
    services, and available virtualised resources. The expected outcome will describe
    the information flows, required information and operation, and when applicable,
    will specify the necessary data model, data format and operation format. It will
    describe how the mobile edge management interfaces reuse mechanisms defined in
    other SDOs, including 3GPP SA5. If modifications to the network management solutions
    defined by these SDOs are needed to support MEC-specific functionality, specification
    of such modifications requires agreement and cooperation with these SDOs. The
    document produced will be a Group Specification that contains normative parts.
