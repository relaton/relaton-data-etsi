abstract:
- content: "A sensor hub is a microcontroller unit/coprocessor/digital signal processor
    that helps to integrate data from different sensors or other chips (WiFi, BlueTooth,
    GPS, etc.) and process them.\r\nA sensor hub is a key components for the user
    data management, pre-processing and presentation to the the device OS and, as
    the processed data is related with personal information, its security requirements
    need to be carefully defined.\r\nHow the sensor hub is materialized depends on
    the architecture. It is sometimes a separate chip, and sometimes included on the
    same chip as the SoC. Due to this there is the need to define common security
    requirements to avoid misuse and leakage of personal data within sensor hubs.\r\nThe
    scope of this work item is to identify the security threats and the related security
    requirements to be fulfilled by a sensor hub in order to:\r\n•\tGuarantee the
    security of data relevant to sensor hub (data storage);\r\n•\tGuarantee the secure
    proper handling of the data within the sensor hub (data processing);\r\n•\tDetermine
    which data can be transfer from the sensor hub and the Device applications and
    which will be the security requirements of the SensorHub interface (data transfer
    and use)\r\n"
