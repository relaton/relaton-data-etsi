- content: "The present document defines the requirements for radio frequency usage
    for Ultra Wide Band (UWB) location tracking devices. These devices operate in
    the frequency range from 6 GHz to 9 GHz and use a fixed infrastructure. It covers
    Ultra Wide Band location tracking tags which are attached to people or objects
    and are tracked using a fixed infrastructure. Operation is mainly indoors. Outdoor
    usage is only allowed under an adequate national licensing scheme.\r\n"
