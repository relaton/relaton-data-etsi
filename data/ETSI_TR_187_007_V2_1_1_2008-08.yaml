abstract:
- content: "This technical report studies the feasibility of media security for TISPAN
    NGN Release 2. Media security as understood in this TR refers to the capability
    to securely transport interactive voice and/or video (including  conferencing
    scenarios) or other multimedia conversational data (including text based) in the
    user plane of an (IMS-based or non-IMS-based) Next Gen Network. The scope of this
    work includes simplex and duplex communication; point-to-point or group-based.\r\nThis
    feasibility study addresses key management/key distribution for user plane (/media)
    and the protection of the media data. The TR may also address media security aspects
    for corporate/home networks in conjunction with NGN. The TR will provide considerations
    on regulatory aspects such as lawful interception, and privacy."
