abstract:
- content: "This final draft European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) addresses\r\nthe
    management of the automatic protection switching within network\r\nelement at
    the high and low order path layers. It covers the Sub\r\nNetwork Connection Protection
    (SNCP) as described in ITU-T\r\nRecommendations G.803 [2] and G.841 [4].\r\nThis
    ETS provides an information model, for the SNCP of Synchronous\r\nDigital Hierarchy
    (SDH) network. This model describes the managed\r\nobject classes and their properties
    for the management of the sub\r\nnetwork connection protection function for SDH
    network elements.\r\nThese objects are relevant to information exchanged across\r\nstandardised
    interfaces defined in the ITU T Recommendation M.3010\r\n[1].\r\nThis ETS applies
    to SDH network elements which perform the sub\r\nnetwork connection protection
    function and those systems in the\r\nTelecommunication Management Network (TMN)
    that manage SDH network\r\nelements.\r\nThis ETS defines:\r\n-\tan information
    model, as related to the sub network\r\nconnection protection function for the
    SDH.\r\n This ETS does not define:\r\n-\tthe protocol stack to be used for message
    communication;\r\n-\tthe network level management processes;\r\n-\tthe application
    contexts;\r\n-\tthe conformance requirements to be met by an implementation\r\nof
    this information model;\r\n-\tinformation models for other systems or equipment.\r\nThe
    information model defined here (and the corresponding message\r\nset) is concerned
    with the management of network elements, the\r\nequipment by which they are implemented
    and the functions contained\r\nwithin them. More precisely, it applies to an equipment
    domain\r\nvisible at the element manager to element interface and is only\r\nconcerned
    with information available within that domain. Information\r\nproper to the domain
    of a network level management processris not\r\nincluded within this model.\r\n"
