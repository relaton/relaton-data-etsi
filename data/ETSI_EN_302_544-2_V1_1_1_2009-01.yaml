abstract:
- content: "To prepare a Harmonised EN covering the essential requirements for Broadband
    Data Transmitting System equipment operating in the frequency range 2 500-2 690
    MHz. It is intended to cover the provisions of Directive 1999/5/EC (R&TTE Directive)
    Article 3.2, which states that: \"... radio equipment shall be so constructed
    that it effectively uses the spectrum allocated to terrestrial/space radio communications
    and orbital resources so as to avoid harmful interference\". \r\nThis work will
    consider the channel arrangements and the requirements as defined in ECC/Dec(05)05."
