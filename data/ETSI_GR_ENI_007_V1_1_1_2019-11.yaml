abstract:
- content: This Work Item will address the aspects of gradual implementation of networked
    intelligence and specify a categorization framework for systems based on several
    different levels (e.g. 5, ranging from fully manual to fully autonomic systems
    as written in ENI whitepaper). This categorization framework will be based on
    the amount of network engineer intervention and attentiveness required and the
    expected interfaces with the assisted system. The details of each level will be
    defined according to scenarios supported and techniques needed.
