  content: " The present document scope is the backfeeding or reverse architecture
    that can supply power to G-PON termination such as ONU or ONT from the customer
    through its access copper pair. \r\nAt minimum, this TR defines a power interface
    over the customer copper pair to the network unit (ONU such as FTTC or FTTB cabinet)\r\nThe
    issues of the back-up (autonomy, locations, environments, safety), reliability
    and monitoring aspects are also addressed.\r\nOther issues about local laws, unbundling
    rules, cost are out of the scope.\r\n.This work will consider the complementary
    work of AT-TM6 on the same subject."
