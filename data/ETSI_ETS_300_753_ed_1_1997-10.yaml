abstract:
- content: "To specify acoustic noise emission (airborn, under normal operating\r\nconditions)
    limits and measurement methods. Primary concern is to\r\nensure that noise levels
    generated by telecoms equipment is within\r\ngenerally accepted limits to minimise
    impact on human activity within\r\nthe relevant environments (so will exclude
    considerations of safety).\r\nProposed to use sound power rather than pressure
    levels for easier\r\ncomparison between different equipments. Will exclude intentional\r\nsound
    emission (such as alarms).\r\nSponsoring ETSI members:  AT&T, Motorola, Digital,
    Alcatel.\r\n"
