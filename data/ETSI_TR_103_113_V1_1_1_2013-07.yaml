abstract:
- content: "The work item will develop a System Reference Document (SRDoc) for mobile
    broadband services in the 2300 MHz – 2400 MHz band under Licensed Shared Access
    (LSA) regime.  The objective of the work item is to enable access to this band
    for mobile broadband services in those CEPT countries where access to the band
    is complex due to the incumbent uses. LSA  when used by IMT/mobile broadband is
    similar to the Authorized Shared Access (ASA) .\r\nThe SRDoc will outline \r\n•\texpected
    usage scenarios \r\n•\ttechnical characteristics and parameters necessary to describe
    the spectrum needs and performance requirements for the deployment of mobile broadband
    services under LSA regime while meeting the constraints of mutual coexistence
    between mobile broadband services and incumbent users based on already existing/further
    CEPT spectrum sharing and compatibility studies \r\n•\thigh level functions required
    to manage/comply with the  requirements for the deployment of mobile broadband
    services under LSA regime.\r\n\r\n[Background]\r\nThe 2300 MHz – 2400 MHz frequency
    band is allocated to the Mobile Service and identified for IMT globally in the
    ITU Radio Regulations. It is targeted for use by TDD technology (e.g. 3GPP LTE
    Band 40). In a number of CEPT countries, the access to this band for mobile broadband
    will be possible, however in a number of other CEPT countries, the access to this
    band will be complex and lengthy due to the incumbent uses such as wireless cameras
    and video links (ENG-links), public safety, amateur services, aeronautical telemetry,
    governmental use (incl. military) and fixed links. The aim is to contribute to
    the availability of the frequency band 2300 – 2400 MHz for mobile broadband within
    CEPT, on a timely manner and under harmonised technical conditions, while taking
    into account the various incumbent uses in a number of CEPT countries.\r\nLSA
    is a new complementary regulatory framework to enable access to spectrum through
    sharing between incumbents and a limited number of “LSA licensees” (e.g. mobile
    network operators). Alongside the use of spectrum by the incumbent, further “LSA
    licensees” can be authorised by the regulators and granted rights to use the radio
    frequencies. It is a right to utilise those parts of spectrum in spatial or time
    domain that are unused by the incumbent, upon agreed terms and conditions defined
    with the incumbent. The agreed conditions may be “static” (e.g. static exclusion
    zone, static time allowed for operation) or more ‘dynamic’ (e.g. geographic/time
    sharing, on-demand authorisation of operators licensed under LSA or on-demand
    restrictions by incumbents). As such, a system for updating, maintaining and providing
    the access conditions is to be established.  A key feature of LSA is to ensure
    a predictable.\r\nquality of service for all spectrum use rights holders, network
    operators and for consumers.\r\nThe harmonisation and use of the 2300 MHz – 2400
    MHz band for mobile broadband across CEPT will benefit from LSA implementation
    due to the variety and foreseen long term usage of incumbents in a number of countries.
    The implementation of LSA by CEPT countries would be on a voluntary basis. Some
    CEPT countries have already plans to release the 2.3 GHz, others are having difficulties
    to make such release on a timely basis and could apply the LSA framework to cope
    with this situation. This will allow CEPT to reap the full benefits of the large
    of economies of scale in TDD equipment.\r\n(1)\tCEPT WG FM, at its 74th Meeting
    in April 2012, agreed that the following tasks should be handled on the LSA concept
    :\r\n-\tStudy the “level of guarantee” in terms of spectrum access that is required
    by an operator to invest in the deployment of a network (or at least in the upgrade
    of its existing network). This notion will, on the other hand, affect the “level
    of guarantee” that the incumbent can ensure to the LSA licensee.\r\n-\tWhen identified
    as a framework relevant for a given frequency band, develop the harmonisation
    framework (ECC Decision, recommendation) with reference to the relevant LSA framework.\r\n-\tDevelop
    general conditions and band-specific technical/operational conditions for the
    implementation of the LSA concept that could be used as guidelines for CEPT administrations.
    These guidelines could be published as an ECC Report. Establish relevant interaction
    with ETSI in order to translate relevant sharing requirements in harmonised standards
    including those in relation with the implementation of the LSA framework.\r\nCEPT
    WG FM also concluded regarding the 2300-2400 MHz band that:\r\n-\tHarmonisation
    work should be undertaken for the implementation of broadband MFCN  in the band;\r\n-\tIncumbent
    use of the 2.3-2.4 GHz band should be ensured through appropriate regulatory framework.
    In that respect, using the LSA concept should be considered.\r\n\r\n"
