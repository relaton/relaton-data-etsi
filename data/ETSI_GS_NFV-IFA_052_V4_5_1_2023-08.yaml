abstract:
- content: The work item specifies the interfaces supported for interoperability between
    the CCM and VIM in the NFV-MANO architectural framework ETSI GS NFV 006, as well
    as information elements exchanged over these interfaces, to support the provisioning
    and management of resources for CIS clusters. The work item will take as input
    (e.g., profile and/or reference) the ETSI GS NFV-IFA 005 and ETSI GS NFV-IFA 006
    specifications. Whether this specification will take into account resource management
    requirements for bare-metal CIS clusters will follow the recommendations developed
    in other features handling aspects regarding physical infrastructure management
    (e.g., FEAT27 on “NFV support for vRAN”, FEAT29 on “Green NFV”).
