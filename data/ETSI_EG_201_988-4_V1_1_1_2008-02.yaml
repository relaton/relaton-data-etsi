  content: "Requirements capture for Open Service Access API version 4 of OSA and
    alignment with 3GPP SA1 22.127 requirements for OSA.\r\nThe deliverable will be
    compiled in conjunction with the OSA/Parlay project.\r\nThe requirements captured
    in this deliverable are intended to provide functionality for benchmark applications.\r\nNew
    requirements should build upon the ETSI Phase 3.0 API and that of the Parlay 4.0
    specification and should be fully backward compatible.\r\nThis deliverable will
    be complimentary to the Web Services TR 01053.The deliverable will cover both
    proposed requirements for enhancements to existing Interfaces and for new interfaces
    from new areas of involvement."
