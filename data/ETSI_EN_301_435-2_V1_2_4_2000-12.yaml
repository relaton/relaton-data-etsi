abstract:
- content: "This Harmonized Standard specifies the technical characteristics to be
    provided by\r\nTETRA terminal equipment which is capable of connection to a Public\r\nTelecommunications
    Network (PTN) and which uses the TETRA technology.\r\nThe objective of this Harmonized
    Standard is to ensure that no disturbance occurs\r\nto the PTN, and to ensure
    interworking btw. PTN and TETRA terminals\r\nand btw. TETRA terminal to TETRA
    terminal so that the communication\r\ncan be routed successfully through the applicable
    network(s).\r\nThe requirements in this Harmonized Standard apply together with
    the attachment\r\nrequirements for the appropriate PTN and the requirement of
    any other\r\napplicable Harmonized Standard . It does not add or reduce the attachment
    requirements unless there is a particular effect on the network which is unique
    to\r\nTETRA.\r\nNote: appropriate PTN refers to Harmonized Standard for basic
    rate ISDN, Harmonized Standard for primary rate ISDN or national regulations (implemeting
    ETS 300 001)\r\nfor PSTN.\r\n TETRA terminal equipment consists of several elements.
    This \r\nHarmonized Standard is structured to allow testing and approval of the
    individual elements as separate items. Because of the need for effective use of
    the radio\r\nfrequency spectrum, the essential air interface characteristics shall\r\nbe
    tested. For each essential requirement, a test is given including\r\nmeasurement
    methods.\r\nRequirements apply to the public network interface and the RF Air\r\nInterface
    of the equipment, which may be stimulated to perform the\r\ntests by additional
    equipment, if necessary.\r\nTerminal equipment may be subject to additional requirements
    in other\r\napplicable CTRs or Directives depending on the functionality (primary\r\nfunctions).\r\nThis
    Harmonized Standard is based on the radio and protocol provisions of ETS 300 394.\r\nThis
    document is a general Harmonized Standard for TETRA terminal equipment, however,
    only certain applications are subject to Directive 91/263/EEC and\r\nhence covered
    by a CTR. It is therefore necessary to check with the\r\nrelevant CTR as to the
    applicability to specific applications.\r\n"
