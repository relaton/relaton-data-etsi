  content: To develop a European standard for the architecture and procedures for
    information exchange between different GLDBs enabling the operation of Cognitive
    Radio System (CRS). This standard will cover the parameters and procedures for
    such information exchange, including security and reliability aspects. Inputs
    from relevant groups such as CEPT will be considered.
