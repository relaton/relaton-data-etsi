  content: "Scope of work to be undertaken:\r\nOrganisations such as Liberty Alliance
    are creating specifications describing how a user's digital identity may be federated,
    i.e. shared between Service Providers and Identity Providers, to provide single
    sign-on and other services over mobile and wired networks.\r\nThere is a strong
    possibility in the mobile sector of using IC cards, especially those issued by
    Mobile Network Operators (e.g. UICC), for authentication, secure messaging and
    secure storage of personal data. Interoperability considerations require the standardisation
    of the UICC/ME interface for the identity parameters on the card.\r\nThis Work
    Item will consider the requirements of Liberty Alliance and other identity forums
    that may have similar requirements. A TS will be created to collate these requirements.
    This document may also contain the technical realisation of these requirements;
    alternatively, these may be realised as CRs to existing SCP documents."
