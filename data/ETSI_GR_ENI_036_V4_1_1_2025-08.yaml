abstract:
- content: This GR intends to demonstrate the network slicing interconnectivity and
    service guarantee capability between ground mobile communication network and satellite
    network under the framework of space-ground cooperative network slicing. This
    GR mainly describes the architecture of space-ground cooperative network slicing,
    the session cooperative mechanism of space-ground slicing, and the intelligent
    adaptation mechanism of slicing services and resources. The space-ground cooperative
    network includes ground mobile communication network and space satellite network.
    This GR will encompass research and investigation activities that will address
    static network environment at the first stage. Subsequent efforts may extend the
    work into dynamic network environment.
