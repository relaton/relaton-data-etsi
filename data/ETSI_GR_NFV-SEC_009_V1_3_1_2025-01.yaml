abstract:
- content: The present document addresses multi-layer administration use cases and
    technical approaches, an issue identified in the Security Problem Statement, ETSI
    GS NFV-SEC 001 [i.1]. Multi-layer administration seeks to provide methods, capabilities,
    procedures and assurances - of various strengths based on requirements and available
    technologies and techniques - that safeguard Virtual Machines or Containers running
    on a virtualisation host ("hosted applications") -from interference (of various
    types) by the host system or platform ("hosting service").  The scope of the present
    document is generally the system comprising the hosting service, associated hardware
    (including TPM, GPU, etc.), software and configuration, and the hosted application.
    Some requirements and measures outside this context are also considered, but not
    necessarily in equal depth. The proposed work item for revision is to update SEC009
    on the term TPM with generic descriptions, including using NFV-SECâ€™s own term
    HBRT, or adding equivalent hardware implementations, just like IETF draft-ietf-rats-tpm-based-network-device-attest-14
    says in the abstract.In addition an update to clause 6.20 to include details on
    virtual HSMs.
