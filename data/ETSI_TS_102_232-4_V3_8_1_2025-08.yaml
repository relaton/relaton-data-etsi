abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies Lawful Interception for an Access Provider
    that has access to layer 2 session information and that is not required to have
    layer 3 information. In this case, the focus of Lawful Interception (LI) for IP
    Network Access is on the portion of the network, commonly referred to as \"layer
    2 interception\", that facilitates subscriber access to the Public IP network.\r\nThis
    revision is to provide Interception without network sessions, and session expiry.\r\n"
