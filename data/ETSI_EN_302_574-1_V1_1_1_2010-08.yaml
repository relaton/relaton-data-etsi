  content: "This Harmonized Standard for two-way communications in the S-bands specifies
    the essential requirements due to the R&TTE (article 3.2) Directive for Satellite
    Earth Station Repeaters operating as part of a satellite network.\r\nThese Earth
    Stations Repeaters transmit to the user terminals and to the satellite in the
    frequency bands allocated to the Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) on a primary basis.
    \r\nDuring the drafting of the Harmonized Standard the work should consider EN
    301 908 and review its applicability to S-UMTS."
