abstract:
- content: "This draft Interim European Telecommunication Standard (I ETS)\r\nspecifies
    the requirements of single fibre and multi fibre single mode\r\noptical fibre
    cables to be used for indoor application. This I ETS is\r\nintended to be used
    to prepare the relevant detail specifications for\r\nindoor cable to cover the
    different conditions experienced in Europe.\r\n This I-ETS does not cover cable
    assemblies, such as connectorized\r\njumper cable, or the functional requirements
    for cable break-out.\r\n "
