abstract:
- content: "The present document gives the objectives and principles of 3GPP security.\r\nThe
    principles state what is to be provided by 3G security as compared to the security
    of second generation systems. The principles will also ensure that 3G security
    can secure the new services and new service environments offered by 3G systems.\r\nThe
    objectives give general, high level requirements for 3GPP security which will
    be expanded upon in 3G TS 21.133 [1].\r\nThe priorities for the implementation
    of 3GPP security are also given.\r\n"
