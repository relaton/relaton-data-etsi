    and identify solutions that potentially could be applied to NFV-MANO\r\n\r\nRecommendations
    for the normative specification of the information models and specification/profiling
    for the data model will be provided. The basis for the report is the use cases
    for policy management documented in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 023 as well as the specifications
    for policy management interfaces and operations on the NFV-MANO reference points.\r\n"
