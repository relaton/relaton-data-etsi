    as part of the NFV Release 5. This edition will add requirements to support the
    Release 5 features. The scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-IFA
    047 specifies the service interfaces for Management Data Analytics (MDA) (i.e.,

    Requirements and operations information model applicable to interfaces exposing
    the MDA services to NFV-MANO and other consuming entities are be defined. Service
    interfaces are produced by architectural elements providing the MDA functions
    described in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 041."
