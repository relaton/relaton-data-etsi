  content: This WID will consider use cases of connected consumer which involves consumer
    electronic devices that utilise network communications capabilities via wired
    and/or wireless network and they can be directly or indirectly controlled by the
    human user e.g. consumer electronics devices that would provide new user experience
    that would utilise communication capabilities in order to send content to other
    human users or devices. These use cases will identify new requirements and functionality/capabilities
    for improving the network for M2M services. Finally this WID is targeting to derive
    M2M requirements and functionalities for M2M architecture which can be supporting
    connected consumer applications.
