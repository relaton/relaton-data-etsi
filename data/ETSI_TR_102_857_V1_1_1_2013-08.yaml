abstract:
- content: This WID will consider use cases of “connected consumer” which involves
    consumer electronic devices that utilise network communications capabilities via
    wired and/or wireless network and they can be directly or indirectly controlled
    by the human user e.g. consumer electronics devices that would provide new user
    experience that would utilise communication capabilities in order to send content
    to other human users or devices. These use cases will identify new requirements
    and functionality/capabilities for improving the network for M2M services. Finally
    this WID is targeting to derive M2M requirements and functionalities for M2M architecture
    which can be supporting “connected consumer” applications.
