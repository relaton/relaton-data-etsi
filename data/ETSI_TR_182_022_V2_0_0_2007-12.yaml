abstract:
- content: "The scope of this WI is to perform an overall analysis of architectural
    requirements for QoS reporting and resource monitoring (i.e. QoS handling). This
    includes analyzing management aspects from an architectural perspective (stage
    2) as well as taking into account the work on performance and QoS for Next Generation
    Networks undertaken by STQ.\r\nBeing an informative document providing a system
    wide description of QoS handling the TR is foreseen to be referenced by the RACS
    release 2 specification (i.e. WI 2036) and potentially other specifications impacted
    by QoS handling. This TR shall not define or re-define functions or interfaces
    needed for QoS handling. Instead, such definitions is expected to be made in normative
    documents such as the RACS release 2 specification."
