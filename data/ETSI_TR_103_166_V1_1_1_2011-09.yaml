abstract:
- content: "Scope: in its initial report, SatEC working group outlines the concept
    of an Emergency Communication Cell over Satellite. This WI intends to describe
    the concept more specifically. The purpose of this work item is to specify for
    the ECCS:\r\n - its physical architecture (e.g. different types of access points,
    computers, satellite terminals, connectors, etc…), \r\n - its functional architecture
    (e.g. caching, security, VoIP or WEB servers, QoS aware scheduling, radio resource
    management, etc),\r\n - the supported services (e.g. data, voice, faxes, GPS positioning,
    Location Based Services, etc…),\r\n - its targeted performances (e.g. throughput,
    transmission delay, power consumption, autonomy, time to deploy, etc...)."
