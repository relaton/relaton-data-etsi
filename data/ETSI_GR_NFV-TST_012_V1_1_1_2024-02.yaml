abstract:
- content: "The document will propose general aspects and related metrics and methods
    for VIM&NFVI performance evaluation.\r\nThe testing area considered by this work
    item is the efficiency of the operation and management of virtual resources, e.g.
    the time of virtualization container instantiation, scaling, migration.\r\nThe
    proposed performance metrics are defined according to the functional requirements
    for VIM described in IFA010.\r\nThe VNF control and management performance is
    out of scope."
