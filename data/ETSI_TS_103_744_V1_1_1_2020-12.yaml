abstract:
- content: This work item is intended to define methods and architectures for combining
    a quantum-safe key encapsulation method with a classical key exchange method to
    ensure the resulting negotiated keys are as secure as the strongest of the individual
    schemes being combined.  The proposal covers how the exchanged elements of the
    methods and the associated shared secrets are combined using a pseudo-random function
    or key derivation function to define cryptographic key material suitable for session
    security.The specification will also cover expected lifecycle maintenance and
    protocol implementation issues.
