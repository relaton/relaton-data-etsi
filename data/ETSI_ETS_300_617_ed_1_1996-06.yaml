abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) describes the\r\nConfiguration
    Management (CM) aspects of Network Elements (NEs) which\r\nconstitute a PLMN with
    initial emphasis on the Base Station System\r\n(BSS) management. This is described
    from a management perspective\r\nbeing decomposed into constituent functionalities,
    which in turn will\r\nallow the construction of a management object model using
    the object\r\noriented paradigm to support open systems management (see GSM 12.20\r\n(ETS
    300 622) [14]). The ETS follows the methodology described in GSM\r\n12.00 (ETS
    300 612-1)[10].\r\nThis ETS defines a set of controls to be employed to effect
    set-up and\r\nchanges to a PLMN, in such a way that operational capability, network\r\nintegrity
    and inter working co operation are ensured. In this way,\r\nthis ETS describes
    the interface behaviour for the management of PLMN\r\nNEs in the context of the
    described management environment. The\r\ncontext is described for both the Operation
    System (OS) and NE\r\nfunctionality. The standardisation of specific controls
    is outside of\r\nthe scope of this ETS.\r\n "
