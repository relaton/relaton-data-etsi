  content: Describe the life cycle as it relates to telecom equipment, including all
    relevant participants (e.g., manufacturers, service providers, resellers), all
    relevant equipment statuses, processes, and events.  Include hardware, firmware,
    software and MIB contents.  The goal of this work is to facilitate definitions
    of equipment management (e.g., MIB, identifiers, RFID, NGOSS) by providing a model
    of the equipment life cycle.
