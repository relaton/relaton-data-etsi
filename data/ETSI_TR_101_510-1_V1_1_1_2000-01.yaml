abstract:
- content: "To consider Security issues which arise from the interconnection of two
    or more INs, when the interface of interconnection is from the SCF or SDF in one
    network to an SSF in another network. This work will be fed in to a revision of
    WI NA-061204. The proposed use of such interfaces in CAMEL phase 1, and other
    talk of such interfaces being used prompts careful study of the security implications,
    which have not previously been addressed.\r\n\r\nReference documents: DTR/NA-061203
    and DTR/NA-061204."
