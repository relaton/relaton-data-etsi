  content: "The present document defines the GEM platform based on MHP [1]. GEM is
    applicable for specifications and standards\r\nbased on the MHP APIs, content
    formats, and semantic guarantees.\r\nThe present document is firstly intended
    to be used by entities writing terminal specifications and/or standards based
    on\r\nMHP. Secondly it is intended for developers of applications that use the
    GEM functionality and APIs. The GEM\r\nspecification aims to ensure interoperability
    between GEM applications and different implementations of platforms\r\nsupporting
    GEM applications. This includes interoperability across different middleware specifications,
    e.g. MHP and\r\nOCAP 1.1 [3]. Implementers should consult the publisher of specifications
    which reference GEM regarding\r\nconformance.\r\nNOTE: The present document defines
    the interfaces visible to applications. Application developers should not\r\nassume
    that any related interface is available unless it is specifically listed. Terminal
    standards or\r\nimplementations may have other interfaces present.\r\nOne of the
    primary goals of the present document is to minimize the number of divergences
    between MHP and GEM\r\nterminal specifications, wherever practical. Divergence
    is defined in clause 3.1. Where divergences are inescapable, the\r\npresent document
    serves as a place to document and control the permitted divergences, so that they
    will be predictable\r\nto terminal manufacturers, broadcasters, and application
    authors.\r\n"
