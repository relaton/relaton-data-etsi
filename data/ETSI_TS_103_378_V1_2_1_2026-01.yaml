abstract:
- content: The present document extends ETSI TS 103 378 with the specification and
    the formalization of SmartBAN unified service/application level representation
    formats, semantic open data model and corresponding ontology. The present document
    is applicable to a BAN and/or a Smart BAN comprising wearable sensors/actuators
    devices, a relay/coordinator device and a Hub, but also distributed monitoring
    and control servers as well as corresponding applications (end user applications
    included). The present document will in particular define a unified description
    model with extensible semantic metadata for Smart BAN service/application level
    that will provide the required BAN abstraction level for enabling discovery and
    composition functionalities as well as semantic interoperability.
