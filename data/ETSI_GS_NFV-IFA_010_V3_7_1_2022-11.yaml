- content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 010 conducts NFV Release 3 maintenance. It corrects
    errors, ambiguities, misalignments, and applies editorial modifications (i.e.
    Corrections of category F and D as described in ETSI TWPs Annex L). This edition
    does not add or modify features, nor does it extend the scope of the former Release
    3 edition summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-IFA 010 specifies functional requirements
    for NFV management and orchestration, and general guidelines and requirements
    for NFV management and orchestration interface design. NFV-IFA 010 does not cover
