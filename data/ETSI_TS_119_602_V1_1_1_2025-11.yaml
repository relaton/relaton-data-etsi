abstract:
- content: "The work shall be defining a data model for lists of trusted entities,
    which shall be an abstract generalization of the existing specifications for trusted
    lists provided in TS 119 612. The data model shall allow for bindings in various
    syntaxes, such as XML, JSON, CBOR or ASN.1, which shall be specified in the TS.\r\nThe
    data model objects shall be specific enough that they allow their use in RTS 119
    605 for the purpose of the process defined within that standard (RTS 119 605).\r\nThe
    data model and the bindings shall allow the specification of profiles for lists
    of Wallet Providers, PID Providers, Wallet Relying Party Access Certificate (WRPAC)
    Providers, Wallet Relying Party (WRP) Registrars, WRP Registers and issuers of
    electronic attestation of attributes issued by or on behalf of a public sector
    body responsible for an authentic source (Pub-EAA Issuers).\r\nThose profiles
    shall be also specified in the TS.\r\nThe work shall take into account past standards
    such as ETSI TS 102 231.\r\nFuture version of the standard should consider international
    aspects."
