abstract:
- content: "This revision of ETS 300 325 shall provide bit compatibility with\r\nCommon-ISDN-API
    v2.0 and ETS 300 325. It shall allow further common\r\nenhancements without loosing
    compatibility with Common-ISDN-API v2.0.\r\nThis PCI shall ensure support to both
    application interfaces.\r\nRemarks: (agreed at TA21)\r\nThe proposed scope is
    technically feasible. It results in offering two\r\ninterface accesses (ETS 300
    325 and Common-ISDN-API v2.0). The\r\ninterfaces can be offered in a way, which
    guarantees binary\r\ncompatibility to applications conforming to either specification.
    The\r\ncode between the interface and the hardware, may or may not be common\r\nto
    both interface accesses. The code for the interface accesses shall\r\ncomply with
    the definitions made for each interface, independant of\r\nwhether the code is
    common or only able to drive one of the interface\r\nspecifications. Future enhancements
    can be performed in a way, which\r\ndoes not destroy this binary compatibility.
    Consequently, this\r\nrevision of ETS 300 325 shall maintain both descriptions
    (ETS 300 325\r\nand Common-ISDN-API v2.0) besides a part, which contains common\r\naspects
    and overall features. With this development future\r\nimplementations will ensure
    cross compatibility between both\r\nspecifications.\r\nETS 300 325 is also to
    be revised to include 3 groups of extensions:\r\n-New exchange mechanism (Windows
    NT, OS2, Netware)\r\n-New user protocols (PPP, SDLC, VMO, inverted MDLC, PCM 56
    kbit/s)\r\n-Miscellaneous features (DTMF, parameter duplication, extension\r\nmessages)\r\n
