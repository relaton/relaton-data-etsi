abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-SOL 014 continues the development of the specification
    as part of the NFV Release 5. This edition will extend the specification of protocol
    and data models to support the Release 5 features. The scope of the former edition
    is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-SOL 014 specifies a set of YAML-based data
    models for descriptor-based virtualised resource management fulfilling the requirements
    concerning the input and output information exchanged over the virtualised resource
    management interfaces specified in the ETSI GS NFV-IFA 005, and the ETSI GS NFV-IFA
    006. NFV-SOL 014 focuses on data models used in the virtualised resource descriptors
    for the Virtualised Compute interfaces, Virtualised Network interfaces and Virtualised
    Storage interfaces, which are used to perform orchestration and lifecycle management
    for consumable virtualised resources comprised of compute, network and storage.
    NFV-SOL 014 also focuses on data models used in the virtualised resource descriptors
    for the Virtualised Resources Change Notification interfaces and Virtualised Resources
    Fault Management interfaces. Other virtualised resource management interfaces,
    as well as data models for information specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 011 and ETSI
    GS NFV-IFA 014, are out of the scope of NFV-SOL 014."
