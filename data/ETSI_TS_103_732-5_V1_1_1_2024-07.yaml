  content: "This PP-Module will focus on the security requirements around the following
    aspects of the Consumer Mobile Device (CMD) as defined in TS 103 732-1: (1) the
    bootloader (the initial software that is executed to initialize the device and
    then proceeds to load the main operating system). (2) The TOE memory configuration
    (ensuring the partitions are properly configured to minimize possible threats).
    (3) The establishment of a root of trust for the CMD to provide authenticity and
    integrity protection right from the start of the bootloader.. These requirements
    would be scoped as a set of high level security requirements as integrated part
    for ensuring the security of a larger device. These requirements are thereby not
    intended to specify the technical details of the individual components.. The requirements
    will be written so certified components may be utilized to satisfy the requirements
    (i.e. using composition). This PP-Module will not introduce security requirements
    in conflict with already existing protection profile for the RoT (e.g. GlobalPlatform
    MCURoT)\r\n"
