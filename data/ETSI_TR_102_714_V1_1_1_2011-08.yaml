abstract:
- content: "This TR describes a framework for end-to-end quality assessment of multimedia
    services. The framework specifies measurement options (e.g. parametric measures,
    perceptual models) at different points in the transmission chain. The framework
    defines measurement options for performing pre-transmission quality assurance,
    in-service network quality measurement, and for client-device quality monitoring.
    The scope is initially limited to non-conversational services (e.g. IPTV, video
    streaming) delivered on an IP network.\r\n"
