abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) provides a detailed spe\r\ncification
    for interworking between the A-interface protocol and the M\r\nobile Application
    Part for handling of supplementary services. The MAP\r\ninterfaces of interest
    are the B-, C-, D- and E-interfaces.\r\nThe A-, C-, D- and E-interfaces are physical
    interfaces while the B-in\r\nterface is an internal interface defined for modelling
    purposes. Infor\r\nmation relating to the modelling interface is not normative
    in this ET\r\nS.\r\nSupplementary service signalling may be passed by the MSC/VLR
    between\r\nthe A- and E-interfaces after inter-MSC handover. This procedure is
    tr\r\nansparent as far as supplementary services are concerned therefore int\r\nerworking
    concerning this process is not described in this ETS.\r\nClause 2 describes general
    procedures for interworking between the A-\r\nand D- physical interfaces.\r\nClause
    3 describes the general procedures for the SS version negotiati\r\non.\r\nClause
    4 describes the mapping of layer 3 radio path messages with Tra\r\nnsaction Capabilities
    (TC) transaction sublayer messages for interwork\r\ning between the A- and D-
    physical interfaces.\r\nClause 5 describes specific interworking procedures for
    all interfaces\r\nrelating to call related SS activity.\r\nClause 6 describes
    specific interworking procedures for all interfaces\r\nrelating to call independent
    SS activity. Clause 6 also covers the in\r\nterworking between the MAP User (see
    GSM 09.02) and the SS handling fu\r\nnctions of the network entities (see GSM
    04.10 and 04.80).\r\nReference is made to the following Technical Specifications:\r\n-\tGSM
    02.04 and GSM 02.8x and GSM 02.9x-series,\t\r\nfor definition of supplementary
    services;\r\n-\tGSM 03.11, GSM 03.8x and GSM 03.9x-series,\t\r\nfor technical
    realization of supplementary services;\r\n-\tGSM 04.10p GSM 04.80, GSM 04.8x and
    GSM 04.9x-series,\t\r\nfor radio path signalling procedures for supplementary
    services;\r\n-\tGSM 09.02 (MAP).\r\n  "
