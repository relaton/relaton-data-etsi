  content: Equipment covered by Harmonized Standard EN 301 489-35 is specialized medical
    equipment that comprises a system consisting of implanted, body worn and other
    external devices that form a medical communications system cell.  Due to the application
    of these devices in the medical field it is proposed to develop a specific product
    EMC standard for ensuring that the radio links are tested to levels appropriate
    for medical devices.
