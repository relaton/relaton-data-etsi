  content: "To produce a Harmonised Standard, taking into account the ongoing ECC
    Report 200 and ECC Report 189, to support Network Based SRDs within the 870 -876
    MHz frequency range, such as Metropolitan Machine Mesh (M3M e.g. TR 103 055) and
    Smart Metering/Smart Grid (e.g. TR 102 886) - TS 102 887 could also of relevance.\r\nIt
    is noted that these SRD equipment will be class 2 to ensure the best spectrum
    efficiency whilst protecting the primary service operating in  some countries."
