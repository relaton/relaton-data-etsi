  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) gives an overview of\r\nthe
    tasks undertaken by a GSM mobile station (MS) when in idle mode,\r\nthat is, switched
    on but not having a dedicated channel allocated,\r\ne.g. not making or receiving
    a call. It also describes the\r\ncorresponding network functions.\r\nNOTE: The
    term GSM MS is used for any type of MS supporting one, or\r\ncombinations, of
    the frequency bands specified in GSM 05.05 (e.g. GSM\r\n900 and DCS 1800).\r\n
    This ETS outlines how the requirements of the GSM 02 series Technical\r\nSpecifications
    (especially GSM 02.11) on idle mode operation shall be\r\nimplemented. Further
    details are given in GSM 04.08 and GSM 05.08.\r\nClause 2 of this ETS gives a
    general description of the idle mode\r\nprocess. Clause 3 outlines the main requirements
    and technical\r\nsolutions of those requirements. Clause 4 describes the processes
    used\r\nin idle mode. There is inevitably some overlap between these clauses.\r\n
