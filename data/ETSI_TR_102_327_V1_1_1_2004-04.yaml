abstract:
- content: "Specify the API of the adaptation layer that:\r\n- HA protocol stacks
    could use for testing over UDP/IP layer\r\n- additional service primitives that
    would not be used to carry protocol messages but may be required to carry other
    relevant information (for example, timing or framing info) \r\n- additional service
    primitives that may be required for exchange of testing related information\r\n-
    examine Test Suite Operations and Upper tester usage to see what is possible to
    use in such an environment and how these could be implemented in the adaptation
    layer, including any service primitives required for that\r\n- specify the way
    these service primitives are meant to be used"
