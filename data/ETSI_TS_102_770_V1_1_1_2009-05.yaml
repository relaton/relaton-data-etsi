  content: More and more consumer multimedia devices are equipped with digital interfaces,
    enabling consumers to losslessly move content they have acquired between devices
    they own for consumption, archiving, conversion and similar purposes. In response
    to the content rights owners' worries about uses of the content not in compliance
    with licences granted eased by those lossless, high quality interfaces, many consumer
    devices are being equipped with content protection and copy management (CPCM)
    technologies. One of the key elements of such systems is the field renewability
    of important parts of such CPCM implementations in order to replace those elements
    which have been compromised and fail in further preventing undesired use of content.
    Those replacement information parts are conveyed to consumer equipment in the
    form of System Renewability Messages (SRM) either as part of the content on pre-recorded
    media or as part of broadcast information. The present document deals with the
    latter.
