abstract:
- content: "This Interim European Telcommunication Standard (I-ETS) applies to\r\noptical
    fibre pigtailed fixed attenuators to be used in single-mode\r\noptical fibre transmission
    networks and which are designed to be\r\nspliced into the optical path.This includes
    splices which are\r\nfabricated to produce an attenuation and which are fitted
    with an\r\nappropriate protector. It does not include variable attenuators or\r\nattenuators
    that are based on connectors. This I-ETS is intended to\r\nestablish uniform requirements
    for the following aspects:\r\n \t- optical, environmental and mechanical properties;\r\n\t-
    test conditions;\r\n\t- acceptance criteria.\r\n Acceptance criteria will be interpreted
    with respect to the\r\nconsideration that some of the parameters specified in
    thsi I-ETS may\r\nbe affected by measurement uncertainty arising either from measurement\r\nor
    calibration errors.\r\n The optical attenuator is: \"A passive optical component
    which produces\r\na controlled signal attenuation when inserted in an optical
    path.\"\r\n "
