abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 036 continues the development of the specification
    as part of the NFV Release 4. This edition will add requirements and improvements
    to support the Release 4 features, such as the support of shared cluster storage
    resources, additional information on descriptors, improvements regarding handling
    of repositories for software and descriptors, reliability and security considerations,
    and as well as additional examples and workflows (e.g. other MCCO types, deployment
    in multiple NFVI-PoPs). \r\nThe scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nIFA036
    specifies requirements on Container Infrastructure Service (CIS) cluster management
    services and descriptors associated to CIS cluster management. The requirements
    apply to service interfaces to be offered for lifecycle management, configuration
    management, performance management, fault management and security management of
    the CIS clusters and to service interfaces to be offered for the management of
    CIS instances and of capabilities of the cluster.\r\n"
