    These models address interoperable solutions for healthcare data collection, transmission,
    storage and interchange with the required security, privacy and reliability.\r\nThe
    next step of this work will be to develop requirements and service architecture
    to provide improved eHealth services involving the relevant stakeholders, including
    users, medical professionals etc.\r\neHealth systems contribute to user ubiquitous
    access to more cost effective healthcare services irrespective to location."
