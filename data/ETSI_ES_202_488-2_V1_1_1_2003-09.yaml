abstract:
- content: "This ETSI Standard defines the second generation of radio-frequency interface
    specifications for high-speed data-over-cable systems in Europe. This document
    may  be based on, but not limited to,  ITU-T SG9 J.122  Recommendation. The work
    is to be developed in coordination with other interested Technical Bodies, such
    as JTC Broadcast.\r\nFurther, the scope of this work item will include definition
    of PHY (physical) and MAC layers for a second generation transmission system for
    IP cable modems.  This second generation provides for advanced coding and adds
    higher order modulation capabilities, while maintaining backwards compatibility
    with the first generation [ES 201 488]."
