abstract:
- content: "The scope for this WI is to specify NORMATIVE rules for how to use the
    Gq', Rq and Ia protocols as of TISPAN release 1. The usage of these protocols
    between the following functional entities is covered by these rules. : \r\n路P-CSCF
    and SPDF using Gq' \r\n路IBCF and SPDF using Gq'\r\n路SPDF and (C- and I-) BGF using
    Ia\r\n路SPDF and A-RACF using Rq\r\nIn addition, to illustrate the usage of these
    rules INFORMATIVE signalling flows between the above-listed entities  are within
    the scope of this WI. \r\nNon-IMS AF entities are out of scope of this WI. Thus,
    the rules for using the Gq', Rq and Ia protocols and the signalling flows provided
    do NOT cover possible signalling scenarios for non-IMS applications. They describe
    however basic principles for how parameters travel via these protocols for IMS,
    which should be considered when using these protocols for non-IMS AF entities."
