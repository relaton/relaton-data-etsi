abstract:
- content: "To prepare a Technical Report  on the Standardization Objectives for Broadband
    Satellite Multimedia using as reference the GMM report.\r\nThere is a growing
    interest in the development and the future deployment of Broadband Satellite Multimedia
    Systems. WRC 97 has allocated and confirmed allocation of new frequencies for
    such systems. Already the US FCC awarded several licenses to construct, launch
    and operate such systems, for providing Broadband Satellite Multimedia services.
    These Systems under development are expected to be deployed around the year 2001/2003.\r\nThe
    European Commission is concerned about the prospects of the European industry,
    operators and users in this area. In particular in the \"EU Action Plan: Satellite
    communications in the Information Society\" (COM(97)0091 - C4-0131/97), the \"speedy
    harmonization of technical standards for advanced, broadband, multi-media satellite
    terminals and receivers\" was highlighted.\r\nThere is a need to promote the technical
    standardization at international level through ETSI, but the contact with all
    these new players is very difficult and cannot be performed in the framework of
    a voluntary committee activities. A survey is necessary to get a clear picture
    of the standardization situation , of the different types of terminals, systems
    ( geostationary, MEO or LEO), and frequencies. The survey will report of the contact
    with all possible players.\r\nRegulatory problems will be analysed in the survey
    on Broadband Multi-media via Satellite, in particular those which are hindering
    the future deployment of such systems. Considerable resources are required to
    collect information, analyse, liaise with other relevant fora and draft standards.
    This can only be achieved within a short time scale with the support of a dedicated
    Specialist Task Force.\r\n"
