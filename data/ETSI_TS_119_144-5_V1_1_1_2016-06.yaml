abstract:
- content: "This multi-part deliverable provides technical specifications for helping
    \ implementers and accelerating the development of PAdES signature creation and
    validation applications. The test results may also be used in conformity assessment
    for signature creation and validation applications (EN 19 103) with policies requiring
    conformity to PAdES formats and procedures.\r\nFirst, it will define test suites
    as completely as possible for supporting the organization of interoperability
    testing events where different PAdES related applications may check their actual
    interoperability. Additionally, it will include the\r\nspecifications required
    for building up software tools for actually testing technical compliance of PAdES
    signatures against the relevant PAdES related technical specifications.\r\nThis
    part 5 will specify, among other things, rules for testing compliance of signatures
    against the PAdES Baseline Profile specification. It will\r\nallow developing
    a tool that could automatically check that a PAdES Baseline signature is fully
    compliant with the relevant part of EN 319 142, without claiming any statement
    on their validity or not. "
