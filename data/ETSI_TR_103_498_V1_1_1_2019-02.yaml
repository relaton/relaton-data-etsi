abstract:
- content: 'The present document provides information on the intended applications,
    the technical parameters, the relation to the existing spectrum regulation and
    additional new radio spectrum requirements for advanced UWB equipment. The present
    document includes necessary information to support the co-operation between ETSI
    and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European Conference of
    Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), including: • Detailed market
    information (annex A); • Technical information (annex B); • Relation to existing
    spectrum regulation (annex C); • Expected compatibility issues (annex D). Requirements
    on the devices for the intended applications are e.g to measure short disctances
    in small containers with an high accuracy (sub mm) and object resolution or to
    detect small and fast objects within a given surveillance area. Therefore a UWB
    SRD allocation with 15 - 20GHz bandwidth is required.'
