  content: "Identify requirements for flexible and agile service development and deployment
    for a multiprovider and multivendor environment.\r\nUse cases for interactions
    between NGN and applications, to help develop requirements above\r\nWhich NGN
    functions and capabilities need to be exposed \r\nWhat are the technical approaches
    available (e.g. Web Services) to expose the functionalities and identify any possible
    impacts in the evolution of the TISPAN architecture and management.\r\nWhat are
    the existing industry efforts in this domain (e.g. TISPAN/NGN (protocols), Parlay/X,
    OSA, OMA, ITU-T, OASIS, WS-I, W3C, among others) and relationship with management
    frameworks (e.g. DMTF/TMF)\r\nPerform a gap analysis between he requirements and
    the existing industry efforts analyzed\r\nIdentify next steps\r\n"
