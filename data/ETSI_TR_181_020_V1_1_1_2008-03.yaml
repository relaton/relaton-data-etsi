abstract:
- content: "·Identify requirements for flexible and agile service development and
    deployment for a multiprovider and multivendor environment.\r\n·Use cases for
    interactions between NGN and applications, to help develop requirements above\r\n·Which
    NGN functions and capabilities need to be exposed \r\n·What are the technical
    approaches available (e.g. Web Services) to expose the functionalities and identify
    any possible impacts in the evolution of the TISPAN architecture and management.\r\n·What
    are the existing industry efforts in this domain (e.g. TISPAN/NGN (protocols),
    Parlay/X, OSA, OMA, ITU-T, OASIS, WS-I, W3C, among others) and relationship with
    management frameworks (e.g. DMTF/TMF)\r\nPerform a gap analysis between he requirements
    and the existing industry efforts analyzed\r\n·Identify next steps\r\n"
