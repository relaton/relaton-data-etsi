abstract:
- content: "The relevance of the semantic work  to assure semantic interoperability
    has driven the development of ontology specifications according to the SAREF methodology.
    IoT  is currently experiencing a period of evolution and adoption in the different
    sectors, as a consequence the SAREF specifications are deemed to evolve quickly
    with the evolution of IoT solutions. \r\nTherefore the SAREF Technical Specification
    suite is expected to evolve dynamically to timely accommodate new needs and contributions
    coming from all the interested stakeholders (from the same or from different domains).
    This requires the adoption of an effective SAREF methodology with the ability
    to point to the latest technical specifications.\r\n\r\nThis EN will specify the
    guidelines for the  application of SAREF methodology in order to:\r\n- apply SAREF\r\n-
    extend SAREF\r\n- evolve SAREF \r\n\r\nThe document will make extensive use of
    references to the SAREF Technical Specification suite and to the SAREF Portal."
