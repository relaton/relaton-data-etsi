  content: The present document defines the security assurance of VIM products, which
    is part of MANO system. The outcome of the present document expects the security
    assets, security threats, security requirements and test cases for evaluating
    the security VIM products. In the present document, the security assurance methodology
    introduced in 3GPP specifications will be leveraged. Security test cases including
    testing goals, testing steps, and evidence of testing results will be produced
    for evaluating whether the security requirements are implemented by VIM based
    products. In this version tests have been added to cover certificate management
    in delegation mode.
