abstract:
- content: "This EN will cover non-contact based UWB devices for external material
    sensing applications in vehicular environments. \r\nThis includes a detailed description
    of the wanted performance requirement, RX-requirements and fixed limits for all
    requirements based on a clear test procedure. Equipment covered by the present
    document operates in accordance with EC DEC on UWB and ECC/DEC(07)01 non-contact
    based UWB material sensing devices and its amendments. \r\n"
