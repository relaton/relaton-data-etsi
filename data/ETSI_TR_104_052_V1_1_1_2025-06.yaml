  script: Latn
  content: The band 76-77 GHz is already used by many applications including ground-based
    vehicle and TTT infrastructure systems (70-03 Annex 5), obstruction/vehicle detection
    via radar sensor at railway level crossings (70-03 Annex 4), obstacle detection
    radars for rotorcraft use (70-03 Annex 5), HD-GBSAR (70-03 Annex 6) and LPR/TLPR
    (70-03 Annex 6). The SRdoc will consider existing ECC sharing studies and will
    describe the use of 76-77 GHz radars for additional applications such as fixed
    surveillance radars. Some countries already permit additional applications and
    examples are described in Annex B.3 of a previous SRdoc, TR 103 148. The SRdoc
    will provide necessary application related information, such as transmitter parameters,
    deployment locations, deployment densities, usage scenarios, etc. The SRdoc will
    also provide discussions and justification on the choice of the frequency band
    and, if possible, will provide a first assessment for coexistence with existing
    applications.
