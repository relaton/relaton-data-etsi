abstract:
- content: The present document describes standardisation requirements for cloud services.
    It is based on the outcome of the ETSI TC GRID Workshop, “Grids, Clouds and Service
    Infrastructures”, 2-3 December 2009. This event brought together key stakeholders
    of the grid, cloud and telecommunication domains to review state of the art and
    current trends. Needs for standardisation, with a particular focus on the emerging
    area of cloud computing and services, were discussed. The present document introduces
    and expands on the conclusions reached. This is not an exhaustive survey and is
    intended to serve as the basis for future work.
