  content: "The scope of the work is to define Generic Autonomic Network Architecture
    (GANA) as an architectural reference model for autonomic networking, cognitive
    networking and self-management that follows the requirements defined in TS 103.194
    which reflects real-world problems which benefit from the application of self-management
    principles. \r\nThe objective of this specification is to describe the GANA reference
    model with its associated Functional Blocks (FBs) and their associated reference
    points that can be instantiated onto target existing or emerging references network
    architectures to create autonomics-enabled reference network architectures. The
    other goal is to describe how human operator could govern end to end autonomic
    networks."
