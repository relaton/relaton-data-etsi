  content: "This Work Item is intended to study  the continuation and integration
    of some HGI Smart Home activities to oneM2M, following the (PT2) HGI announcement
    of its closure by June 2016.\r\nThe TR associated with this WI intends to be used
    in order to regularly inform HGI about the status progress of this continuation
    and integration and will be a useful tool for both HGI and oneM2M to check that
    all items expected to be integrated are appropriately handled.\r\nThe WI is expected
    to provide CRs to oneM2M deliverables as listed below.\r\n"
