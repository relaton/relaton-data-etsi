  content: "This work item updates the Application Package Format and Descriptor Specification
    to cover maintenance and development of the MEC specifications.\r\nThe package
    format and descriptor format for MEC Applications are based on input from ETSI
    ISG NFV documents, mainly ETSI GS NFV-SOL 004 and ETSI GS NFV-SOL 001 as well
    as definitions from ETSI GS MEC 010-2. The updates will include alignment to version
    3.2.1 of ETSI GS MEC 010-2, and also the support of containers, possibly based
    on NFV advancements. They may also include alignments with 3GPP (e.g. EDGEAPP)
    and GSMA OPG, if necessary.\r\n"
