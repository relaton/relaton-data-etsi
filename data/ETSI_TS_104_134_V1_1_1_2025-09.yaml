  content: The objective of this work is to provide a standardized method to assess
    in a simplified manner the avoided environmental impact resulting from the introduction
    of ICT Solutions. A method is defined based on existing standards and recognised
    methods which allow for communication of the results to the public and consumers.  The
    uncertainty and sensitivity calculation procedures are standardized for the method
    to be developed to make visible the relation between the degree of simplification
    and the ability to draw conclusions.
