  content: "The document provides a common understanding of the technical concepts
    of the Diagnosis, Logging and Status service between ITS-Ss. The proposed service
    supports e.g. the communication of measurement data for maintenance and information
    purposes. One field of application will be the predictive maintenance of devices
    on railroad tracks, the status information of the train platform to the train
    vehicles, etc.\r\n"
