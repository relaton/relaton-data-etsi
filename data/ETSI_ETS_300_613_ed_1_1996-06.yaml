abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) gives a description of\r\nthe
    function associated with the administration of data related to\r\nsubscribers,
    mobile equipments and services, specifically from the\r\nnetwork management point
    of view.\r\nThis data, known as the Subscriber Profile, is used for the provision\r\nof
    services for a particular user of a PLMN, or for the user s\r\nequipment represented
    by the International Mobile Subscriber Identity\r\n(IMSI) and the International
    Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)\r\nrespectively. The functions include the administrative
    procedures for\r\nboth the subscriber (for example  provision of service ), and
    the\r\nequipment identified by the IMEI. Also included is the management of\r\nsubscriber
    data necessary for network management.\r\nThe managed functional entities involved
    are the Home Location\r\nRegister (HLR), Visitor Location Register (VLR), Mobile
    Switching\r\nservice Centre (MSC), Equipment Identity Register (EIR),\r\nAuthentication
    Centre (AUC). The administration of subscriber data in\r\nall these entities is
    part of this ETS; which includes the means for a\r\nPLMN Operator to create, update,
    and delete information concerning a\r\nparticular subscriber in order to allow
    (or bar) the use of the\r\nnetwork.\r\n "
