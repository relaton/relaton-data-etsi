abstract:
- content: "There exist many guideline documents for the design of ICT products and
    services, for example ETSI Guide EG 202 116 \"Guidelines for ICT products and
    services; 'Design for All'\", is aimed at designers and provides advice on human
    factors aspects when designing ICT devices.  STF 266 is currently producing an
    ETSI guide on \"Guidelines for the design and deployment of ICT products and services
    used by children\".  However, the market is moving to push services targetted
    at the under 12s.  This specialised group of users have specific needs which need
    to be taken into consideration.  There as yet do not exist any guidance documents
    on how this can sensitivly be done. \r\nThis new work will produce guidance for
    service providers who are considering providing information services targeted
    at the under 12s as to how best to do this so that the services produced are acceptable
    to parents, teachers and child agencies."
