  content: "This TBR specifies those technical requirements under\r\nArticles 4.1
    to 4.5 of Council Directive 93/97/EEC that\r\napply to satellite earth station
    equipment that is capable\r\nof operation in one or more of the following frequency
    ranges:\r\n - 10,70 to 11,70 GHz (Space - Earth, shared)\r\n- 12,50 to 12,75 GHz
    (Space - Earth, exclusive)\r\n- 14,00 to 14,25 GHz (Earth - Space, exclusive)\r\n-
    14,25 to 14,50 GHz (Earth - Space, shared)\r\nof the Fixed Satellite Service (FSS).\r\n
    These requirements are taken from ETS 300 157/159/160.\r\n This TBR does not contain
    the essential requirements under Article 4.6\r\nfor interworking via the public
    telecommunications network in\r\njustified cases, and does not provide any guarantee
    of correct\r\ninterworking between satellite earth station equipment.\r\n This
    TBR specifies the requirements for satellite earth station\r\nequipment that\r\n
    - is capable of being used either for transmission only, or for\r\ntransmission
    and reception (transmit-receive), or for reception only\r\n(receive-only), of
    radio-communication signals in any of the bands\r\nspecified above;\r\n - is not
    within the scope of other Ku-band TBRs (TVRO, SNG, LMES);\r\n - has a diameter
    of 3,8 m or less;\r\n - is not purpose built satellite earth station equipment
    intended for\r\nuse as part of the public telecommunications network.\r\n This
    TBR applies to all satellite equipment as described above,\r\nirrespective of
    whether the satellite earth station equipment provides\r\nadditional interfaces,
    telecommunications services or functions.\r\nHowever additional TBRs may also
    apply.\r\n"
