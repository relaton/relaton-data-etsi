    text including issues such as the reference model(s)\r\n·Items mentioned in TR102
    629 as under study including:\r\noDelivery of voice band telephony (i.e. Baseband
    POTS) over a reverse power fed DSL system\r\noReverse powering states\r\noPower
    sharing billing model\r\noLine testing\r\noPowering status monitoring\r\noConcatenated
    reverse powering architectures\r\n·Definition and specification of a suitable
    power splitter  \r\nLiaison and cooperation with other competent Standards bodies
    (specifically ETSI EE, ITU-T Q4/15 and Broadband Forum)."
