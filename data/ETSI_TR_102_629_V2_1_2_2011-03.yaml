abstract:
- content: "The objective of this work is to develop a TR that studies requirements
    and issues relating to the implementation of reverse power feed to the Network
    Operator's remote transmission system from the customer's premises.\r\nIt is proposed
    that the new TR should address the following issues:\r\n·Elaboration of the current
    text including issues such as the reference model(s)\r\n·Items mentioned in TR102
    629 as under study including:\r\noDelivery of voice band telephony (i.e. Baseband
    POTS) over a reverse power fed DSL system\r\noReverse powering states\r\noPower
    sharing billing model\r\noLine testing\r\noPowering status monitoring\r\noConcatenated
    reverse powering architectures\r\n·Definition and specification of a suitable
    power splitter  \r\nLiaison and cooperation with other competent Standards bodies
    (specifically ETSI EE, ITU-T Q4/15 and Broadband Forum)."
