abstract:
- content: "•Content distributors often use multiple Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
    to distribute their content to the end-users. They may upload a copy of their
    catalogue to each CDN, or more commonly have all CDNs pull the content from a
    common origin. Alternate URLs are generated, one for each CDN, that point at identical
    content. DASH players may access alternate URLs in the event of delivery problems.
    Content steering describes a deterministic capability for a content distributor
    to switch the content source that a player uses either at start-up or midstream,
    by means of a remote steering service.\r\n•This work is carried out under the
    PAS agreement between ETSI and DASH-IF"
