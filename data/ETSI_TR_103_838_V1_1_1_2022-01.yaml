abstract:
- content: "This technical report is for companies and organisations of all sizes
    who want to implement a vulnerability disclosure process. It is not intended to
    be a comprehensive guide to creating and implementing a vulnerability disclosure
    process, but instead focuses on an essential offering.\r\nThe report will contain
    examples of vulnerability disclosure policy, action plans and generic advice on
    how to respond to a vulnerability disclosure.\r\nThis work is complementary to
    ISO/IEC 29147:2018 Information technology — Security techniques — Vulnerability
    disclosure, ETSI's own CVD process and can be used to support EN 303 645."
