    for the network side of the T reference point or coincident S\r\nand T reference
    point for the pan-European Integrated Services Digital\r\nNetwork (ISDN) as provided
    by European public telecomunications\r\noperators by means of the Digital subscriber
    Signalling System No. one\r\n(DSS1) protocol, for Network Integration Testing
    (NIT) covering the\r\nend-to-end support of ISDN services.\r\nThe pan-European
    ISDN is made up by connecting the different national\r\nnetworks and End-to-end
    NIT covers all the testing activities\r\nnecessary to access the correct behaviour
    of the interconnected\r\nnetwork from the point of view of access interfaces,
    network side.\r\nBoth bearer services (and associated teleservices) and supplementary\r\nservices
    are checked for interworking capability and compatibility, in\r\nthe pan-European
