- language: en

  content: "EN 301 753 is likely to be published in the OJ in few months, it presently
    reflect the status of published TM4 ENs by end 2000 but there are already a number
    of new ENs and revisions undertaking ETSI approval process and a number in advanced
    work in TM4.\r\nThese also need the possibility to benefit of a Harmonised EN
    for simplifying R&TTE conformance.\r\nMoreover some formal improvement might be
    necessary due to the necessary feedback of the initial period of application (e.g.
    for the receiver parameters and the antenna issue)."
