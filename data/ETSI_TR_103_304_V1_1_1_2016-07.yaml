  content: "The present document proposes a number of scenarios focusing on today's
    ICT and develops an analysis of possible risks, threats and vulnerabilities in
    mobile and cloud based services. It also presents technical challenges and needs
    derived from regulatory aspects (lawful interceptions). The intent is to consolidate
    a general framework, in line with regulation and international standards, where
    technical solutions for PII protection can be plugged into.\r\n"
