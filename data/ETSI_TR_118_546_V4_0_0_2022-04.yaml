  content: "The scope of this WI is the study on public warning service enabler of
    oneM2M system. It would be further extended to the normative work once the first
    informative study is finished. The public warning service will be provided by
    authorities (e.g. government) that they can send warning information to things
    as well as human beings in disaster areas. Therefore, those things can properly
    perform actions to protect people and reduce scale of damages. E.g. lock the gas
    pipes in cities. To enable this service over oneM2M system, the study includes
    following technical scope. \r\nCase studies of existing public warning systems.\r\nUse
    cases and potential requirements for automated or intelligent devices that re-act
    emergency.\r\nArchitecture analysis for the new use cases and requirements with
    current oneM2M system.\r\nSecurity impacts analysis.\r\nAbstract data models for
    public warning services.\r\nSemantic interworking between the data models and
    extended oneM2M ontology.\r\n\r\n"
