abstract:
- content: "Given that there are already test specifications related to the Diameter
    protocol profile for the Rf and the Ro reference points under validation, it seems
    reasonable to extend the INT set of test specifications to also cover Diameter
    on the Sh and Dh reference points as similar procedures are covered on those interfaces.
    This would complete the set of test specification for the technical area of IMS
    subscriber authentication and authorization.\r\n\r\nFollowing the methodologies
    developed and used by ETSI this means productions of a multi-part document covering
    the both the static conformance review (PICS proforma) and the dynamic conformance
    review (Test Purposes, Abstract Test Suite). The result would be a complete set
    of Diameter test suites for internal and external Diameter message exchanges.\r\n\r\nETSI
    members of the above mentioned trials have expressed their interest in test specifications
    related to the Diameter protocol profile for the Sh and Dh reference point as
    defined in ETSI TS 129 328 and ETSI TS 129 329 and also declared their willingness
    to review the outputs of this STF and in a later stage in a potential follow-up
    project provide ETSI with the possibility to validate the outputs of this STF
    against their LTE components (i.e. HSS, AS, OSA OCS, SLF). See also list of supporting
    organisations.\r\n"
