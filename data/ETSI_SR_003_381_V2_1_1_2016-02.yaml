  content: "The purpose of this WI is to understand the needs of the Cloud Computing
    community on a relatively granular scale, with feedback from the users needs to
    be collected and analysed, to ensure that their priorities are fully taken into
    account. This will also allow for an identification of their highest priority
    (existing or new) use cases and for some refinement of the CSC Phase 1 report
    conclusions.\r\n\r\nAn on-line Questionnaire will focus primarily the Cloud Computing
    users (e.g. SMEs, Administrations) and will identify some high priority use cases.
    A further analysis of the material collected will be done to assess the availability
    and maturity of standards for their implementation. As a result, some recommendations
    regarding the deployment of Cloud Computing services will be derived. "
