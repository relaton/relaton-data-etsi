abstract:
- content: "This work item aims to specify the technical requirements and solutions
    based on PDL to build a native self-sovereign identity (SSI) system under the
    constraints of telecom networks so that a user or a network node holding such
    an identity can access network services among different operators and service
    providers seamlessly. Specifically, this WI will deliver specifications in the
    following aspects:\r\n1). Methods of lifecycle management of the SSI associated
    with a user device / a network node of a telecom network\r\n2). Architecture changes
    for realizing the new identity system natively in a telecom network\r\n3). Revisions
    to legacy service procedures and new service procedure design based on the proposed
    identity framework"
