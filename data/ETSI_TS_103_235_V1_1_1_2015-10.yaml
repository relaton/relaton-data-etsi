abstract:
- content: "This Technical Specification defines the system architecture for the operation
    of Licensed Shared Access, enabling operation of Mobile Broadband Systems under
    Licensed Shared Access regime. The architecture builds on the scenarios and applications
    described in ETSI TR 103 113 “Mobile Broadband Services in the 2 300 MHz – 2 400
    MHz Frequency Band under Licensed Shared Access Regime”, and the system requirements
    captured in ETSI TS 103 154 “System requirements for operation of Mobile Broadband
    Systems in the 2 300 MHz–2 400 MHz band under Licensed Shared Access (LSA) regime”.\r\n\r\nThe
    scope of the work will be to define the architecture of a system which enables
    LSA following the requirements developed in TS 103 154. . The Technical Specification
    will serve as an input for defining the Harmonized Standards and European Standards
    that are part of the EC mandate for Reconfigurable Radio Systems (M/512). Therefore,
    this work will be performed in a close liaison with the Joint Task Force ERM RRS
    (JTFER) related to EC Mandate M/512.\r\n\r\nThe specification should include:\r\n\r\n
    -Functional architecture \r\n- Identification of the different entities, reference
    points, and mapping of functions to entities\r\n- Identification of interfaces
    to be standardized\r\n - High level procedures and information flows enabling
    coordination of spectrum resource usage between Incumbent(s) and Licensee(s)\r\n\r\nAs
    part of the specification work, consideration will be given to the need for the
    LSA System to interwork with different MFCN architectures (including both macro
    and small cell deployments). "
