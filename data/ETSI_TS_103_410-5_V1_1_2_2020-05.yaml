abstract:
- content: "Specify an initial extension to SAREF to include the semantic model for
    extension to industry and manufacturing domains, including deployment and related
    services aspects. .\r\nThis initial extension will be based on a limited set of
    use cases and available existing data model identified in the corresponding requirement
    TR.\r\nThis work is expected to be developed in close collaboration with AIOTI,
    the H2020 Large Scale Pilots and with ETSI activities in these domains.\r\nFurther
    extensions are envisaged in the future to cover entirely these domains. "
