abstract:
- content: This work will be focused on the unique aspects related to providing robustness
    and resiliency in a virtualized network architecture. Items like application portability,
    fault monitoring, isolation and recovery, and other mechanisms necessary to maintain
    service sustainability will be considered as part of this effort. This work will
    also identify the requirements for resiliency of the network comprised of virtualized
    network functions.
