  content: "This Specification proposes a stage-2\r\nservice description for a High
    Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD) on\r\nGSM.\r\nIn analogy with CCITT Recommendations
    I.130 [7] (refer to annex A) and\r\nwith reference of CCITT Recommendations VI.1
    Q.65 [8](Stage 2 of the\r\nmethod for characterisation of services supported by
    an ISDN), the\r\nsecond stage of the HSCSD is defined as follows.\r\nStage 2 identifies
    the functional capabilities and information flows\r\nneeded to support the service
    as described in Requirements of High\r\nSpeed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD), GSM
    01.34 [6]. Furthermore, it\r\nidentifies various possible physical locations for
    the functional\r\ncapabilities. The output of Stage 2, which is signalling system\r\nindependent,
    is used as an input to Stage 3, the design of signalling\r\nsystem and switching
    Recommendations.\r\n "
