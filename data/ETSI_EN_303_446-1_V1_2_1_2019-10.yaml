  content: 'The standard sets requirements for combined radio and non-radio equipment
    in the domestic environment in respect of ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
    u The standard, together with ?ETSI EN 301 489-1; ?plus the relevant parts of
    the ETSI EN 301 489-series for the specific radio technologies deployed; ?plus
    the relevant CENELEC EMC product standard(s) specifies the applicable test conditions,
    performance assessment and performance criteria for radio equipment, including
    any associated ancillary equipment. Technical specifications related to the antenna
    port of the radio equipment are not included in the standard. Such technical specifications
    are found in the relevant product standards for the effective use of the radio
    spectrum. In case of differences (for instance concerning special conditions,
    definitions, abbreviations) between this standard and ETSI EN 301 489-1, the provisions
    of this standard take precedence. The environmental classification and the emission
    and immunity requirements used in this standard are as stated in ETSI EN 301 489-1,
    except for any special conditions included in this standard. The content and conclusions
    of the newly developed EG 203 367 will be taken into account during the development
    of this standard. '
