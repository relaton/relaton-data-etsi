    requirements based on a clear test procedure.\r\nTherefore, this EN will cover
    devices for handheld â€œbuilding material analysis (BMA) working within the frequency
    2.2 to 8GHz. The operation modes will include the wanted performance requirements
    for object determination inside the building material and building material characterization
    (e.g. moisture)  \r\nEquipment covered by the present document operates in accordance
    with EC DEC on UWB and ECC/DEC(07)01 and its amendments.\r\nA first collection
    of open points which shall be considered (in addition) are uploaded as:  ERMTGUWB(17)040003
