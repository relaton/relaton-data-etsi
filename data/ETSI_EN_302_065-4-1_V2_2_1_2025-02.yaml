  content: "This work item to amend the former version of EN 302 065-4 V1.1.1 is targeted
    to address the request of the EU desk officer. This includes a detailed description
    of the wanted performance requirement, RX-requirements and fixed limits for all
    requirements based on a clear test procedure.\r\nTherefore, this EN will cover
    devices for handheld building material analysis (BMA) working within the frequency
    2.2 to 8GHz. The operation modes will include the wanted performance requirements
    for object determination inside the building material and building material characterization
    (e.g. moisture)  \r\nEquipment covered by the present document operates in accordance
    with EC DEC on UWB and ECC/DEC(07)01 and its amendments.\r\nA first collection
    of open points which shall be considered (in addition) are uploaded as:  ERMTGUWB(17)040003
    and TGUWB(17)040007\r\n"
