abstract:
- content: The present document describes an RFID Plugtest that was performed at the
    MGI centre in Neuss and at the VanDerLande premises in Veghel during the period
    11th  - 15th  June 2008. The purpose of the tests was to investigate if there
    were any problems of interoperability when multiple tags manufactured by different
    vendors were simultaneously present in the same interrogation field.
