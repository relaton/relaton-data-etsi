abstract:
- content: The present document has been developed to describe the security and trust
    guidance that is unique to NFV development, architecture and operation. Guidance
    consists of items to consider that may be unique to the environment or deployment.
    Supplied guidance does not consist of prescriptive requirements or specific implementation
    details, which should be built from the considerations supplied. Guidance is based
    on defined use cases, included in the present document, that are derived from
    the Security Problem Statement and are unique to NFV. Relevant external guidance
    will be referenced, where available. The proposed work item for revision is to
    update SEC003 on the term TPM with generic descriptions, including using NFV-SECâ€™s
    own term HBRT, or adding equivalent hardware implementations, just like IETF draft-ietf-rats-tpm-based-network-device-attest-14
    says in the abstract.
