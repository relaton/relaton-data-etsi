abstract:
- content: Update of the definition of return channels and corresponding protocols
    enabling interactive services in mobile interactive broadcast systems. The work
    concerns satellite broadcast systems operating in the 2 GHz MSS S-band, typically
    applying DVB-SH. All channels use the 2 GHz MSS band. This part defines the physical
    layer specification for the return link asynchronous access and will be updated
    mainly based on the experimental results obtained in the EC co-funded project
    SafeTRIP.
