abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this work item is to continue the development of GS ENI
    005 v2.1.1 to add:\r\n- define and specify APIs, Interfaces, and protocols used
    by ENI based on information and data models,\r\n- specify the ENI cognition model
    in detail\r\n- enhance the description and specification of the ingestion, normalisation,
    and   output generation of data, information, and policies (imperative, declarative,
    and   intent) in greater detail\r\n- enhance the description and specification
    of the control loops used in ENI\r\n- enhance the description and specification
    of policy management used in ENI\r\n- enhance the description and specification
    of architectural principles for interacting  with other groups within and outside
    ETSI."
