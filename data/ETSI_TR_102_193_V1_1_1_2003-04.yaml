  content: "Study and definition of radio specific ATM and IP aspects for P-P and
    P-MP systems. Definition of a generic reference model for radio equipment with
    relevant reference points for determining  radio requirements and of measurement
    points for evaluating radio parameters (e.g. BER curve, interference sentivity,
    etc.). The results and description contained into the report will be used to revised
    the conformance test  standard in order to insert test methods for radio equipment
    implementing ATM and IP functionality\r\n"
