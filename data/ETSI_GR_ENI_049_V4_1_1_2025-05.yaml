abstract:
- content: "The present document recommends network autonomic levels for Data Center
    networks, describing the closed-loop management process characteristics at each
    level (from Level 1 to Level 5). Specific focus will be set on enablers for deployment
    of applications and assurance lifecycle phases to enable applications in the data
    center network: which are the most time-consuming and error-prone ones. General
    Computing and AI computing are both proposed to be in target. This document will
    follow the general framework provided by other GRs on categorization. \r\n\r\n"
