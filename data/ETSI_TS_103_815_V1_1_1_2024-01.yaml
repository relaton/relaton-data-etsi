  content: This document specifies requirements and  guidelines for cyber security,
    credential related security, electromechanical security and mechanical security
    (e.g. refering to existing CEN standards) of consumer residential connected smart
    door locking devices. This document builds on EN 303 645 for cyber security requirements,
    adding additional provisions specific to smart door locking devices. This document
    builds on other standards for credential related security, electromechanical security
    and mechanical security. The document includes both product security performance
    requirements and test methodology. The intent is to provide an appropriate level
    of assurance.
