abstract:
- content: Technical specification on radiated measurements up to 100 GHz and general
    arrangements for test sites where radiated measurements are performed (i.e. revision
    of existing content and additional considerations for frequencies above 1 GHz
    / 18 GHz). This material then can be used as a normative reference in other ETSI
    deliverables such as ES, EN, HEN that include radiated measurements. This new
    document will complement the work on measurement uncertainty in ERM TG27. This
    NWI replaces the work item for TR 102 896 (upgrade from TR to TS)
