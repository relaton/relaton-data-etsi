abstract:
- content: "The present document applies to radio transmitters and receivers, for
    use on vessels, operating in either the Medium Frequency (MF) only or in the Medium
    and High Frequency (MF/HF) bands allocated in the International Telecommunications
    Union (ITU) Radio Regulations [4], to the Maritime Mobile Service (MMS).\r\nThe
    present document refers to equipment for one or more of the following:\r\n-Single
    SideBand (SSB) modulation for telephony transmission and reception (J3E);\r\n-Frequency
    Shift Keying (FSK) or SSB modulation of a keyed sub-carrier to transmit and receive
    Digital Selective Calling (DSC) signals in accordance with ITU-R Recommendation
    M.493-10 [5].\r\nThe present document also refers to radio equipment, which is
    not integrated with the DSC encoder or decoder, but defines the interfaces with
    such equipment.\r\nNOTE 1:The requirements for integrated equipment may be found
    in other relevant EN/ETSs.\r\nThe present document is intended to cover the provisions
    of Directive 1999/5/EC (R&TTE Directive) [1] article 3.2, which states that \"â€¦..
    radio equipment shall be so constructed that it effectively uses the spectrum
    allocated to terrestrial/space radio communications and orbital resources so as
    to avoid harmful interference\".\r\nThe requirements in the present document are
    applicable to receivers for operating on all frequencies in the bands 1 605 kHz
    to 4 000 kHz or 1 605 kHz to 27,5 MHz as allocated in the ITU Radio Regulations
    [4], to the MMS.\r\nOther spot frequency receivers should meet all the requirements
    of the present document and other relevant standards as applicable for the frequencies
    and modes provided.\r\nIf the equipment, or parts of it, are designed in such
    a manner that they can be used for other categories of maritime radiocommunication
    (e.g. Morse telegraphy or NBDP - ETS 300 067 [6]), those parts of the equipment
    should fulfil the relevant requirements of the appropriate standards for the service(s)
    in question e.g. ETS 300 067 [6].\r\nIn addition to the present document, other
    ENs that specify technical requirements in respect of essential requirements under
    other parts of article 3 of the R&TTE Directive [1] will apply to equipment within
    the scope of the present document.\r\n\r\n"
