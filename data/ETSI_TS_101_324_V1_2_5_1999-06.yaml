  content: "This work item deals with naming, numbering, and addressing issues spe\r\ncific
    to calls from IP based terminal to E.164 terminals (PSTN/ISDN/GS\r\nM). It includes
    the name for the E.164 terminal that is used by the IP\r\nbased terminal and how
    it maps to the address of an appropriate gatew\r\nay and to the destination of
    the call. There will be an investigation\r\ninto existing schemes that may be
    relevant to this problem. Requiremen\r\nts for an acceptable solution will be
    developed.\r\n After requirements are validated by the ETSI TIPHON Project, existing\r\nas
    well as new schemes will be evaluated with respect to the requireme\r\nnts and
    specifications will be made.  The impact of carrier selection\r\nwill be considered
    in evaluating solutions.  Acceptable solutions must\r\nwork with both IPv4 and
    IPv6.\r\n  "
