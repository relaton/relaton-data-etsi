abstract:
- content: "Transmission System proposal for Digital multi-programme Television\r\nby
    suitable for distribution in Satellite Master Antenna Television\r\n(SMATV) systems.\r\nThis
    ETS is complementary to ETS 300 429 (Cable) and it is aligned\r\nwith ETS 300
    421 (Satellite). The system described in this ETS is\r\ncompatible with the modulation
    and channel coding systems used for\r\ndigital multi-programme television by cable
    and satellite\r\ntransmission.\r\nThe system is based on the MPEG-2 System Layer,
    with the addition of\r\nappropriate Forward Error Correction (FEC) technique.\r\nThe
    system allows for further evolution as technology advances and is\r\ncapable of
    starting a reliable service as of now.\r\n"
