abstract:
- content: "This Technical Basis for Regulation (TBR) specifies the technical\r\nrequirements
    to be met by terminal equipment capable of connecting to\r\na public telecommunications
    network. These requirements apply to\r\nterminals for Phase 2 of the public land
    mobile radio service,\r\noperating in the 900 MHz band with a channel separation
    of 200 kHz,\r\nutilising constant envelope modulation and carrying traffic channels\r\naccording
    to the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) principle.\r\nThis TBR specifies the
    terminal equipment access requirements for the\r\nGSM 900 version of the Global
    System for Mobile communications (GSM).\r\nFor each test purpose and its corresponding
    conformance requirement, a\r\nreference is given to the test method in ETS 300
    607-1 (GSM 11.10-1)\r\n[2]. The requirements apply at the air interface and the
    Subscriber\r\nIdentity Module - Mobile Equipment interface for the access\r\nrequirements,
    which may be stimulated to perform the tests by\r\nadditional equipment if necessary.\r\nThe
    measurement uncertainty is described in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM\r\n11.10-1) [2].\r\nThis
    TBR covers the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive\r\n91/263/EEC
    [1] Articles 4d, 4e, 4f. Non access related aspects of\r\nspeech telephony, where
    Article 4g has been applied, are covered by\r\nTBR 20.\r\nThe Terminal Directive
    91/263/EEC [1] Articles 4a and 4b are covered\r\nby other directives, and, therefore,
    not by this TBR.\r\nIn this TBR, there are no Electromagnetic Compatibility technical\r\nrequirements
    in terms of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1],\r\nArticle 4c.\r\nNOTE: Technical
    Requirements for EMC performance and testing of the\r\nequipment are covered by
    the relevant standards applicable to the EMC\r\nDirective 89/336/EEC, Annex A.\r\nTerminal
    equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other\r\nCommonbTechnical
    Regulations (CTR) depending on the equipments\r\nfunctionality.\r\nETS 300 607-1
    (GSM 11.10-1) [2] constitutes the conformance test suite\r\nfor GSM. The verification
    of the conformance requirements in this TBR\r\nis based on the tests described
    in this reference. The set of\r\nrequirements in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2]
    and the set of\r\nrequirements in this TBR need not be identical.\r\nSome requirements
    only apply to specific types of mobile station (e.g.\r\ndata tests only apply
    to mobile stations with a data facility). The\r\nTBR also indicates the specific
    test which should be carried out for\r\neach mobile station type.\r\nAn active
    accessory is covered by this TBR if it modifies the terminal\r\nperformance in
    an aspect which affects conformance to essential\r\nrequirements.\r\nNOTE: Only
    active devices are subject to this TBR. Accessories may\r\nbe tested with specific
    terminals, and either approved for use with\r\nthose terminals only, or may possibly
    be approved for use with a wider\r\nrange of terminals, depending on the nature
    and effect of the\r\naccessory.\r\n "
