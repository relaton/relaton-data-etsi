  content: Linked Data Event Streams (LDES) is a data publishing approach where a
    dataset is described as an ever-growing collection of immutable objects. Its basic
    use case is to enable consumers to stay synchronized with a dataset, as well as
    to retrieve historical changes. The LDES specification is a living standard and
    is endorsed by the Semantic Interoperability Community (SEMIC) that develops semantic
    data solutions for European public administrations. This report investigates how
    LDES sources can be consumed by NGSI-LD context brokers and vice versa how NGSI-LD
    context brokers can make their context information available to LDES consumers.
