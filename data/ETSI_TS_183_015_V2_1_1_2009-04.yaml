    an analysis of the re-use of the Tool-kit of 3GPP to deliver the service. If new
    capabilities are needed they should be defined in cooperation with 3GPP and in
    accordance with RFC3427.\r\nInteroperability between networks must be taken into
    consideration. \r\nInterworking between NGN and PSTN/ISDN will be specified."
