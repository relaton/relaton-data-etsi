  content: The purpose of this work item is to identify the role of privacy as one
    of the components of the Security of AI and proceed with the attempt to define
    Privacy in the context of AI that covers both, safeguarding models and protecting
    data, as well as the role of privacy-sensitive data in AI solutions. It investigates
    and addresses the attacks and their associated remediations where applicable,
    considering the existence of multiple levels of trust affecting the lifecycle
    of data. Appropriate means to label/protect/anonymize privacy-sensitive data elements
    during data collection and processing are studied aiming to protect privacy-sensitive
    data, while limiting AI performance impact. The investigated attack mitigations
    include Non-AI-Specific (traditional Security/Privacy redresses), AI/ML-specific
    remedies, pre-emptive remediations (left of the boom"), and reactive responses
    to an adversarial activity (right of the boom). In addition, the anticipated delivery
    document will seek to align terminology with existing ETSI SAI ISG documents and
    studies, and will reference previously-studied privacy attacks and remediations
    (see ETSI GR SAI 004, ETSI GR SAI 002). The anticipated delivery document will
    also provide a summary of academic and industrial experience in privacy protection
    for AI.
