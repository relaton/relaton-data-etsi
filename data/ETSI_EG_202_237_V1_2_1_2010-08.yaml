abstract:
- content: This document gives general guidance on the specification and execution
    of interoperability tests for communication systems specifically in the context
    of product certification. It provides a framework within which interoperability
    test specifications for a wide range of product types can be developed. The guidelines
    are expressed as recommendations rather than strict rules and leave enough freedom
    to allow test specifiers to adopt and adapt processes to suit each particular
    project while still ensuring that test specifications accurately reflect the requirements
    of the base standards and can be executed consistently across a range of configurations.
