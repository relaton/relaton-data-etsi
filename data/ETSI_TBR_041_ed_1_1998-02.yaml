abstract:
- content: "This TBR specifies those technical requirements under Article 4 of\r\nCouncil
    Directive 93/97/EEC [1] that apply to Mobile Earth Station\r\n(MES) equipment
    with both transmit and receive capabilities for\r\noperation in a Satellite -
    Personal Communications Network (S-PCN).\r\n These MESs include handheld, portable
    and vehicle mounted equipment\r\nor may be a component in a multi-mode treminal;
    they may consist of a\r\nnumber of modules with associated connections and user
    interface, or\r\nmay be self contained, single units.\r\nIf the MES is a component
    in a multi-mode terminal, this TBR applies\r\nonly to the MES component of the
    terminal, unless otherwise stated.\r\n The frequency bands within which the MESs
    operate as as follows:\r\n -\t1610-1626,5 MHz, (MES transmit)\r\n-\t1613,8-1626,5
    MHz (MES receive) and\r\n-\t2483,5-2500 MHz (MES receive).\r\n The technical requirements
    in this TBR are in two major categories:\r\n \tunwanted emission: to protect terrestrial
    and other satellite\r\n\tradio services from harmful interference generated by
    the MES\r\n\tin normal use;\r\n \tMES control and monitoring: to speicfy the a
    minimum set of\r\n\tControl and Monitoring Functions (CMF) that shall be\r\n\timplemented
    in each MES in order to minimise the probability\r\n\tthat they originate unwanted
    transmissions that may give rise\r\n\tto harmful interference to other systems.\r\n
    These requirements are taken from ETS 300 733 [3].\r\n Network Control Facilities
    (NCF) for MES networks are defined by\r\nreference to  ETS 300 735 [2].\r\n This
    TBR does not contain the essential requirements under articles\r\n4f and 4g for
    interworking via the public telecommunications network,\r\nand does not provide
    any guarantee of correct interworking between\r\nMES equipment.\r\n The Terminal
    Directive 91/263/EEC Articles 4a and 4b are covered by\r\nother Directiies and
    therefore, are not covered by this TBR.\r\n "
