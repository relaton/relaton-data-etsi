  content: "The present document specifies test methods, technical parameters and
    performance requirements for assessment of the Quality of Experience when using
    Active Noise Cancellation Headsets with speech and music content.\r\nThis revision
    provides enhanced considerations for wind noise generation in Annex A, and updates
    related clauses accordingly. Additionally, this revision provides: (1) informative
    minimum performance reference scores for the current tests, (2) improvements to
    test efficiency, (3) tests for adaptation of ANC to acoustic path changes (leak),
    (4) tests to address howling mitigation and (5) enhancements to the acoustic leak
    robustness tests."
