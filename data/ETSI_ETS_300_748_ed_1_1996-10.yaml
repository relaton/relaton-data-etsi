abstract:
- content: "Modulation and channel coding system for the distribution of digital\r\nmulti-programme
    Television (TV)/High Definition Television (HDTV) by\r\nMultipoint Video Distribution
    Systems (MVDS) in the 40 GHz band.\r\nThe System described in this ETS is based
    on that described in\r\nETS 300 421 for 11/12 GHz satellite services.  It allows
    the same\r\nconsumer Integrated Receiver Decoder (IRD) to be used for either\r\nservice,
    when used with a Low Noise Block (LNB) down-converter for the\r\nappropriate frequency
    band.\r\nThe frequency band 40,5 to 42,5 GHz has been harmonised within CEPT\r\nunder
    Recommendation T/R 52-01.  The System however, is applicable to\r\nother frequency
    bands above 10 GHz.\r\nThe System uses Quaternary Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation
    and\r\nconcatenated error protection strategy based on a convolutional code\r\nand
    shortened Reed-Solomon (RS) code.\r\nThe System is suitable for use on different
    MVDS transmitter\r\nbandwidths.\r\nCompatibility with Moving Pictures Experts
    Group-2 (MPEG-2) coded TV\r\nservices (see ISO/IEC IS 13818-1), with a transmission
    structure\r\nsynchronous with the packet multiplex, is provided.  Exploitation
    of\r\nthe multiplex flexibility allows the use of the transmission capacity\r\nfor
    a variety of TV service configurations, including sound and data\r\nservices.
    \ All service components are Time Division Multiplexed (TDM)\r\non a single digital
    carrier.\r\n "
