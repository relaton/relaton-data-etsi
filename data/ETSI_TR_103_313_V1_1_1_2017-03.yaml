  content: "The present document provides information on the intended applications,
    the technical parameters, the relation to the existing spectrum regulation and
    additional new radio spectrum requirements for UWB equipment for the operation
    in medical, wellness and assisted living environments and applications.\r\n\r\nThe
    applications can be divided in 3 different categories:\r\n- Category A: Sensor
    and Imaging\r\n- Category B: Communications\r\n- Category C: Hybrid sensor and
    communications\r\n- Category D: Location and tracking \r\n\r\nThe application
    environments of the presented technologies will cover home environments for assisted
    living applications, hospital environments including doctors surgeries and automotive
    environments.\r\nThe present document includes necessary information to support
    the co-operation between ETSI and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC)
    of the European Conference of Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT),
    including:\r\n\tDetailed market information (annex A);\r\n\tTechnical information
    (annex B);\r\n\tRelation to existing spectrum regulation (annex C);\r\n\tExpected
    compatibility issues (annex D).\r\n"
