abstract:
- content: "This report examines the functional requirements for a broadband V\r\ninterface
    in conjunction with the previously defined V5 and ISDN\r\nprotocols in order to
    define a usefule set of protocol component\r\nparts. At this stage, the report
    shall not attempt to define a unique\r\nprotocol stack for a new version of a
    Vb interface (which would\r\nsupport narrowband, broadband and asymmetric services
    through ANs).\r\nNew protocols may be identified if required.\r\n  "
