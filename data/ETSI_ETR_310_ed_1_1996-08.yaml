abstract:
- content: "To describe traffic capacity and spectrum requirements\r\nfor multi-system
    and multi-service DECT applications\r\ncoexisting in a common frequency band.
    Configurations for\r\ntypical DECT applications, and relevant mixes of these,\r\nincluding
    residential, office, public and RLL applications,\r\nshall be defined and analysed,
    mainly by advanced simulations.\r\n"
