abstract:
- content: This work item defines objective and quantitative metrics for the service
    qualities delivered by NFV service providers to the VNFs hosted on NFV infrastructure
    which can impact end user service qualities. These objective metrics are useful
    when setting service level objectives between organizations operating VNFs (e.g.,
    voice-over-LTE service delivered to end users) and organizations operating NFV
    infrastructure (e.g., virtual compute, virtual networking) and functional blocks
    offered as-a-service (e.g., database-as-a-service). These metrics are designed
    to be included in industry standard service level agreement frameworks (e.g.,
    TMForum, NIST) and service assurance offerings
