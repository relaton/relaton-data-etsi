  content: Revision of TS 103 645 to improve applicability and testability of the
    document as baseline security and data protection standard. The focus of the revision
    is to clarify the provisions in clauses 5 and 6, and to expand clause 6 in order
    to address gaps in the data protection provisions. If necessary, edits will also
    be made to other sections to resolve any inconsistencies with updated clauses
    5 and 6. The global applicability to all consumer IoT devices within the existing
    scope of the TS is to be preserved.
