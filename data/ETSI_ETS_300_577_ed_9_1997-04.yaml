abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunications Standard (ETS) defines the\r\nrequirements
    for the transceiver of the pan-european digital mobile\r\ncellular and personal
    communication systems operating in the 900 MHz\r\nand 1800 MHz band (GSM 900 and
    DCS 1800).\r\nRequirements are defined for two categories of parameters:\r\n-
    those that are required to provide compatibility between the\r\nradio channels,
    connected either to separate or common antennas, that\r\nare used in the system.
    This category also includes parameters\r\nproviding compatibility with existing
    systems in the same or adjacent\r\nfrequency bands.\r\n - those that define the
    transmission quality of the system.\r\n This ETS defines RF characteristics for
    the Mobile Station (MS) and\r\nBase Station System (BSS). The BSS will contain
    either Base\r\nTransceiver Stations (BTS) or microcell base transceiver stations\r\n(micro-BTS).
    The precise measurement methods are specified in GSM\r\n11.10 and 11.20.\r\nUnless
    otherwise stated, the requirements defined in this ETS apply to\r\nthe full range
    of environmental conditions specified for the equipment\r\n(see Annex D).\r\nIn
    this ETS some relaxations are introduced for GSM 900 mobile\r\nstations which
    fulfil the following conditions:\r\n- pertain to power class 4 or 5 (see section
    4.1.1);\r\n- have a total weight less than 200 g (excluding battery);\r\n- have
    a volume less than 500 cm3 (excluding battery).\r\n In this standard these mobile
    stations are referred to as \"small MS\".\r\nMobile stations may operate on more
    than one of the frequency bands\r\nspecified in section 2. These mobile stations,
    defined in GSM 02.06,\r\nare refered to as \"Multi band mobile stations\" in this
    standard. Multi\r\nband mobile stations shall meet all requiremwnts for each of
    the bands\r\nsupported. The relaxation on GSM 900 for a \"small MS\" are also
    va0id\r\nfor a multi band MS if it complies with the definition of a small MS.\r\nThe
    RF characteristics of repeaters are defined in Annex E of this\r\nETS. Annex D
    and E are the only sections of this ETS applicable to\r\nrepeaters. Annex E does
    not apply to the MS or BSS.\r\n "
