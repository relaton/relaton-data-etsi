abstract:
- content: "To describe a set of best practice concepts for Privilege Access Workstations
    (PAWs) that would benefit the Telecoms Industry, amongst others. PAWs can mitigate
    a large number of security threats and can reduce the attack surface of an Operator,
    their vendors and service providers. Standardisation of these concepts will provide
    greater consistency, ensure that costs can be reduced for all parties and will
    help to create a common understanding for implementation. \r\nThis work item is
    part 2 dealing with connectivity and key design concepts and is a follow on from
    Privilege Access Workstation Part 1: Physical Device.\r\n"
