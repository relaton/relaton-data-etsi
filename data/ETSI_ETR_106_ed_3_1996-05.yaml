abstract:
- content: "No mandatory protocol between the Service Centre (SC) and the Mobile\r\nSwitching\r\nCentre
    (MSC) below the transfer layer is specified by GSM ; this is a\r\nmatter\r\nof
    agreement between SC and PLMN operators.\r\n This report specifies three approaches
    to the specification of\r\nprotocol stacks\r\nof communication protocols for the
    purpose of relaying short messages\r\nand\r\nalerts between Short Message Service
    Centres and Gateway/Interworking\r\nMSCs\r\n(GMSC) for the Short Message Service
    (SMS). One approach is based upon\r\nuse of\r\nthe complete OSI reference model
    (see X.200), another approach is\r\nbased upon\r\nthe use of only the lower three
    OSI layers, and another approach is\r\nbased upon\r\nthe use of CCITT Signalling
    System No. 7 (see Q.700).\r\n Alternative protocol stacks are specified via ASN.1
    encoding rules\r\n(see X.208\r\nand X.209). These alternative protocol stacks
    are examples for the\r\nimplementation of the Short Message Relay Layer (SM-RL).
    The\r\nrequirements\r\nplaced upon the Short Message Relay Layer are briefly described
    in\r\nSection 9\r\nof GSM 03.40.\r\n Specifications are based upon individual
    contributions. Any judgement\r\nconcerning functionality, completeness and advantages/disadvantages
    of\r\nimplementation is intentionally omitted.\r\n This will be an updated version
    of ETR 106 (i.e. Edition 2).\r\n "
