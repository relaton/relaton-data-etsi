  content: "This revision was issued purely in order to correct the value for \"Loop
    Model 3 is 0.25Y, 0.4mm PE\" in the v1.5.2 the value is 0,5Y\r\n\r\n- Below the
    work item scope of TS 101 135 v1.5.2 -\r\nThis work item studies the problems
    involved in combining the transmission of ISDN-BA (or POTS) and 2048kbit/s data
    transmission over HDSL transmission systems. The output of the work item shall
    be the addition of a new sub-clause 7.7 for insertion in a version 1.5.1 of TS
    101 135 V1.4.1. The purpose of this work item is to allow the problems involved
    in combining 2048kbit/s and ISDN-BA (or POTS) to be solved separately from the
    work being carried out under TS 101 135 V1.4.1, and if necessary to find a solution
    that would not be permitted within the scope of ETR152, for example a modification
    of the basic HDSL core frame structure. This allows TS 101 135 V1.4.1 to\r\nbe
    completed according to schedule, and allows sufficient time to find an optimum
    solution for embedding ISDN-BA in HDSL systems. \r\n"
