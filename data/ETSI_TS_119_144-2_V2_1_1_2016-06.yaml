abstract:
- content: "This document provides technical specifications for helping implementers
    and accelerating the development of PAdES signature creation and validation applications.
    The test results may also be used in conformity assessment for signature creation
    and validation applications (EN 19 103) with policies requiring conformity to
    PAdES formats and procedures.\r\nFirst, it will define test suites as completely
    as possible for supporting the organization of interoperability testing events
    where different PAdES related applications may check their actual interoperability.
    Additionally, it will include the\r\nspecifications required for building up software
    tools for actually testing technical compliance of PAdES signatures against the
    relevant PAdES related technical specifications.\r\nThis part 2 will be used by
    entities interested in testing tools that generate and verify PAdES signatures
    not adhered to any specific profile, but compliant with the mother PAdES specification
    as defined in EN 319 142.\r\nA first version of this document was published by
    ETSI in March 2012. It will be reviewed and updated if considered worth in the
    view of comments arrived and the outcome of PAdES interoperability test events
    conducted before its consolidation."
