abstract:
- content: 'The work item will:  (i) Analyze specific radio propagation aspects for
    THz communication, such as molecular absorption, effect of weather conditions
    (e.g., rain), effect of micro-mobility, specific considerations for scattering,
    reflections, and diffractions, and considerations for near-field propagation effects;  (ii)
    Analyze data from earlier measurement campaigns published in relevant literature;  (iii)
    Perform channel measurements for the identified channel measurement scenarios
    and frequency bands;  (iv) Develop channel models for the identified channel measurement
    scenarios and frequency bands.'
