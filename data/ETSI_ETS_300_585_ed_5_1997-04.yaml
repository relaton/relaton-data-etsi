abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) defines three interface\r\nprotocols
    for control of SMS functions within a GSM mobile telephone\r\nfrom a remote terminal
    via an asynchronous interface.\r\nSection 2 defines a binary protocol (“Block
    Mode”). The protocol\r\nincludes error protection and is suitable for use where
    the link may\r\nnot be completely reliable. It will be of particular use where
    control\r\nof remote devices is required. Efficient transfer of binary encoded\r\nuser
    data is possible.\r\nSection 3 defines a character-based interfaced based on “AT”
    commands\r\n(“Text Mode”). This mode is suitable for unintelligent terminals or\r\nterminal
    emulators, and for application software built on command\r\nstructures like those
    defined in V.25ter. Some of the commands defined\r\nin Section 3 will also be
    useful for implementations of Section 2\r\nand/or Section 4, for example enabling
    an indication of incoming SMS\r\nmessages.\r\nSection 4 defines a character-based
    interface with hex-encoded binary\r\ntransfer of message blocks (“PDU Mode”).
    This mode is suitable for\r\nsoftware drivers based on AT command structures which
    do not\r\nunderstand the content of the message blocks and can only pass them\r\nbetween
    the MT and “upper level” software resident in the TE.\r\nIn all three modes, the
    terminal is considered to be in control for\r\nSMS/CBS transactions.\r\nThis specification
    considers the mobile termination to be a single\r\nentity. Other GSM Technical
    Specifications describe the split of\r\nfunctionality between the mobile equipment
    and SIM.\r\n  "
