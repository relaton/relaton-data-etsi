  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) defines three interface\r\nprotocols
    for control of SMS functions within a GSM mobile telephone\r\nfrom a remote terminal
    via an asynchronous interface.\r\nSection 2 defines a binary protocol (Block Mode).
    The protocol\r\nincludes error protection and is suitable for use where the link
    may\r\nnot be completely reliable. It will be of particular use where control\r\nof
    remote devices is required. Efficient transfer of binary encoded\r\nuser data
    is possible.\r\nSection 3 defines a character-based interfaced based on AT commands\r\n(Text
    Mode). This mode is suitable for unintelligent terminals or\r\nterminal emulators,
    and for application software built on command\r\nstructures like those defined
    in V.25ter. Some of the commands defined\r\nin Section 3 will also be useful for
    implementations of Section 2\r\nand/or Section 4, for example enabling an indication
    of incoming SMS\r\nmessages.\r\nSection 4 defines a character-based interface
    with hex-encoded binary\r\ntransfer of message blocks (PDU Mode). This mode is
    suitable for\r\nsoftware drivers based on AT command structures which do not\r\nunderstand
    the content of the message blocks and can only pass them\r\nbetween the MT and
    upper level software resident in the TE.\r\nIn all three modes, the terminal is
    considered to be in control for\r\nSMS/CBS transactions.\r\nThis specification
    considers the mobile termination to be a single\r\nentity. Other GSM Technical
    Specifications describe the split of\r\nfunctionality between the mobile equipment
    and SIM.\r\n  "
