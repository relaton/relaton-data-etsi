  content: "Today High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) enables first Ultra HD broadcast
    services (also referred as 4K resolution) via existing DVB specifications. Recently
    some High Dynamic Range (HDR) standards have been released by SMPTE (SMPTE ST
    2084 and SMPTE ST 2086). However, they define an HDR signal that is not directly
    compatible with Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) CE devices. Thus, these devices require
    upstream external processing adapting the HDR signal to a supported video format
    in order to render the video signal. Additionally, existing production and distribution
    infrastructures as well as play out may not be compatible with the SMPTE HDR standards
    with respect to carriage and signaling of the metadata in these standards.\r\nThe
    goal of this proposed ETSI Work Item is to standardize an HDR system addressing
    direct backwards compatibility i.e. a system leveraging SDR distribution networks
    and services already in place and that enables high quality HDR rendering on HDR-enabled
    CE devices including high quality SDR rendering on  SDR CE devices. Requirement
    for the described solution is that it is single layer to ensure that bit rate
    overhead for HDR and implementation complexity in CE devices will be low.\r\nAn
    additional requirement is that the resulting standard should take into account
    HDR technologies currently standardized in other bodies such as ITU-R, ITU-T,
    SMPTE or ISO."
