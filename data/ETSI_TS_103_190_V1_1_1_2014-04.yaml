  content: The document specifies a coded representation of audio information, and
    specifies the decoding process. The coded representation specified therein is
    suitable for use in digital audio transmission and storage applications. The coded
    representation may convey full bandwidth audio signals, along with a low frequency
    enhancement signal, for multichannel playback. Additional representations can
    be included, targeting e.g. listeners with visual or hearing disabilities. A wide
    range of encoded bit-rates is supported by the document, ranging from state-of-the-art
    compression to perceptually lossless rates. The coded representation is designed
    with system features such as robust operation, video frame synchronicity, and
    seamless switching of presentations.
