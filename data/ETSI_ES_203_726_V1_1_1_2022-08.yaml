abstract:
- content: "This document will give solutions for progressive migration of telecom/ICT
    sites to 400VDC distribution and direct use of 400VDC powering at equipment level
    from 400VDC sources. It describes: \r\n- hybrid architecture with 400/48V conversion
    close to existing -48V equipment using existing -48V room distribution and ability
    to clear fuse fault without -48V batteries.\r\n- solution to produce AC as an
    alternative to UPS to power existing AC equipment. - modular and flexible solution
    to swap from -48V or AC to 400VDC. \r\nIt proposes also 400VDC power transfer
    between existing 48V centralized source to high power density equipment such as
    terarouter to save a lot of copper and reduce cable volume having a easier connection."
