    of the Voice Broadcast Service (VBS) which allows the\r\ndistribution of speech
    (or other signals which can be transmitted via\r\nthe speech codec), generated
    by a service subscriber, into a\r\npredefined geographical area to all or a group
    of service subscribers\r\nlocated in this area.\r\nThe Voice Broadcast Service
    (VBS) is applicable to all mobile stations\r\nin a certain network and area which
    have the technical capability and\r\nthe respective subscription to receive a
    VBS call.\r\nNOTE: It is not considered as requirement that normal GSM phase 2\r\nmobile
    stations will be able to be used for this service.\r\nThe service is described
    from the service subscriber s and user s\r\npoint of view; in particular:\r\n-
    the procedure for normal operation with successful outcome;\r\n- the action to
    be taken in exceptional circumstances;\r\n- the interaction with other GSM services
    and features.\r\n This specification does not deal with the Man-Machine Interface
    (MMI)\r\nrequirements, but makes reference to the appropriate Global System for\r\nMobile
    communications (GSM) specifications.\r\nThis specification defines a teleservice
    of the digital cellular\r\ntelecommunication system GSM. Any interaction with
    other services\r\nand/or networks not dealt within clauses 8 or 9 are outside
