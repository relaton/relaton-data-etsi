  content: "This GSM Technical Specification (GTS) specifies the stage one\r\ndescription
    of the Voice Broadcast Service (VBS) which allows the\r\ndistribution of speech
    (or other signals which can be transmitted via\r\nthe speech codec), generated
    by a service subscriber, into a\r\npredefined geographical area to all or a group
    of service subscribers\r\nlocated in this area.\r\nThe Voice Broadcast Service
    (VBS) is applicable to all mobile stations\r\nin a certain network and area which
    have the technical capability and\r\nthe respective subscription to receive a
    VBS call.\r\nNOTE: It is not considered as requirement that normal GSM phase 2\r\nmobile
    stations will be able to be used for this service.\r\nThe service is described
    from the service subscriber s and user s\r\npoint of view; in particular:\r\n-
    the procedure for normal operation with successful outcome;\r\n- the action to
    be taken in exceptional circumstances;\r\n- the interaction with other GSM services
    and features.\r\n This specification does not deal with the Man-Machine Interface
    (MMI)\r\nrequirements, but makes reference to the appropriate Global System for\r\nMobile
    communications (GSM) specifications.\r\nThis specification defines a teleservice
    of the digital cellular\r\ntelecommunication system GSM. Any interaction with
    other services\r\nand/or networks not dealt within clauses 8 or 9 are outside
    the scope\r\nof this specifications.\r\n"
