  content: "The scope of this Work Item includes:\r\nElaborating various options for
    the use of MQTT within oneM2M, including but not limited to, the binding of Mca
    and Mcc primitives to MQTT:\r\nIdentifying the benefits of each option to oneM2M
    users and to existing MQTT applications\r\nDocumenting this option analysis in
    a new TR \r\nIdentifying and proposing any changes that might be needed to TS-0001\r\nSpecifying
    the binding of Mca and Mcc primitives to MQTT in a new TS\r\nIdentifying any changes
    that might be needed to TS-0004\r\nIdentifying any enhancements that might be
    needed to oneM2M Resources \r\n[Secondary] Identifying enhancements to future
    versions of the MQTT protocol that would be of advantage to oneM2M\r\nThis specification
    had a dependency on the Core API protocol specification (TS-0008) for data models.\r\n"
