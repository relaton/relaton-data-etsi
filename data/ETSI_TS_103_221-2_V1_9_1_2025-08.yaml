abstract:
- content: "The internal network interface covers wide area connections between LI
    systems and (depending on the network) a large number of network elements from
    different vendors. Nearly every network element has its own interface with different
    transport protocols, authentication (if any), encryption (if any), commands etc.
    This makes every new connection highly complicated and costly. The interfaces
    between Administration and Mediation Functions are usually proprietary and implemented
    internally within a product for LI and therefore need not be compatible between
    products of different vendors. Traditionally internal interfaces have not been
    standardized. Given the experience of standardization in HI2 and HI3 industry
    has received benefits from this by way of interoperability, security and cost
    reduction. This WI does not intend to force compatibility on legacy equipment
    although should that be possible it will be welcomed. The initial focus is on
    newer IP related systems (but not limited to IP). With a view to the future, as
    network and services become virtualized this WI intends to support newer implementations
    by ensuring a standard interface is available for the provisioning of equipment
    or service. The DF/MF (delivery / mediation function) translates network internal
    X2/3 messages to HI2/3 (standardized handover interface to the LEMF). This function
    allows insulation for the CSP to manage their network appropriately without untoward
    impact on the LEMF.\r\nThis revision is to Clarify ProductID and XID relationship."
