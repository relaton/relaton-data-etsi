  content: "This deliverable will explore and analyse the relation between ontologies
    and Digital Twins.  While the basic functions of Digital Twins in terms of reflection
    and replication are strictly related to the virtual representation of the real
    objects, the relation with semantic and ontologies work in SAREF and oneM2M is
    direct in terms of providing a commonly understandable representation. Other functions
    of the Digital Twin such as composability, augmentation and predictability require
    more analysis. So this deliverable will focalize on gaps and requirements, including
    aspects such as Digital Twin representation, reflection, context/situation detection,
    event representation, replication, composability and augmentation.\r\nThe deliverable
    will concentrate on potential gaps in existing SAREF and oneM2M specifications,
    and on potential inputs from other interested groups, in particular the industry
    associations engaged in the use of Digital Twins"
