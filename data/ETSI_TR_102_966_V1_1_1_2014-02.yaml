  content: "The scope of the Work Item will be to study the interworking between M2M
    Area Network technologies and the ETSI M2M architecture.\r\nThe results of this
    study include, but are not limited to: how the M2M Area Network technologies functional
    elements map into the M2M architecture, possible optimizations of the M2M architecture
    to accommodate peculiarities of the M2M Area Network technologies, potential limitations
    that may lead to changes to the M2M Area Network technologies to be reported to
    the other body, etc.\r\nThe study is limited to the M2M Area Network technologies
    listed in the following:\r\nZigBee.\r\nOther technologies are expected to be included
    subject to an update of this WID."
