abstract:
- content: "Identification of Standardization Areas and of relationships among\r\nthem
    as a first step towards the identification and assignment of\r\nindividual work
    items within the Multimedia scope (ref. TCR-TR 026).\r\nPriorities will be assigned
    both to Standardization Areas and to\r\nrelationships among Standardization Areas
    as a step towards priority\r\nsetting. Short value statements will be appended
    to each identified\r\nStandardization Area and to each relationship, specifying
    whether the\r\narea is a new one or an existing one and indicating, in both cases,
    in\r\nwhich direction the future work should be oriented, with which view,\r\nwhich
    approaches and which consideration of related Standardization\r\nAreas. The work
    will be based on the results of the Multimedia\r\nPortfolio and the Functional
    Model and will take into account the\r\nactivities and projects from international
    and European Standards\r\nBodies and from commercial initiatives and fora.\r\n "
