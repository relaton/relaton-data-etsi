abstract:
- content: "This work item will report on architecture options to support the offering
    of NFV MANO services across multiple administrative domains. \r\nInitial use cases
    to be considered are: NFVIaaS and NS over multiple administrative domains. \r\nThe
    report will examine:\r\n(1)\tInteractions between functional blocks belonging
    to different administrative domains. \r\n(2)\tThe need for potential extensions
    to the MANO architecture. Different architecture options may be analysed.\r\n(3)\tIdentification
    of the functional blocks involved in the use cases and analysis of potential functional
    enhancements. \r\n(4)\tThe need for new reference points and interfaces between
    the functional blocks involved in the use cases. The need for potential changes
    to existing interfaces will be studied.\r\nRecommendations for preferred options
    are provided and potential impact to existing IFA specifications is identified.\r\nMulti-site
    connectivity and its management will not be covered by this WI but is covered
    by IFA022. Security and trust domains will not be considered in this WI but is
    covered by IFA026.\r\nThe resulting work item deliverable will be informative."
