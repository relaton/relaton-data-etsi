  content: "The present document provides information on the intended applications,
    the technical parameters, the relation to the existing spectrum regulation and
    additional new radio spectrum requirements for MicroWave Security Scanners (MWSSc).
    MWSSc are expected to comply with limits outside the scanning scenario in the
    order of those in ECC/DEC(06)/08 for undesired emissions.\r\nThey are similar
    to mmW Scanners descibed in SRdoc TR 103 664 (security scanner 60-90 GHz) but
    operate in a much lower frequency range with low power and have a dedicated application
    in security screening;  e.g to detect objects concealed in or underneath a persons
    clothing and to display the location of the objects on e.g. a human avatar. The
    present document includes necessary information to support the co-operation between
    ETSI and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European Conference
    of Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT)."
