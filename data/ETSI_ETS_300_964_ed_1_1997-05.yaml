  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) gives a description of\r\nthe
    general baseband operation of full rate speech traffic channels in\r\nthe transmitter
    and in the receiver of GSM Mobile Stations (MS)s and\r\nBase Station Systems (BSS)s
    during Discontinuous Transmission (DTX).\r\nFor clarity, the description is structured
    according the block diagram\r\ns in figures 1 and 4. Except in the case described
    next, this structur\r\ne of distributing the various functions between system
    entities is not\r\nmandatory for implementation, as long as the operation on the
    air int\r\nerface and on the speech decoder output remains the same.\r\nIn the
    case of BSSs where the speech transcoder is located remotely in\r\nthe Base Station
    Controller (BSC), the implementation of the interfac\r\nes between the DTX Handlers
    and the Radio Subsystem (RSS) as described\r\nin this ETS together with all their
    flags is mandatory, being a part\r\nof the A bis  interface as described in GSM
    08.60. In this case the va\r\nrious flags also serve to avoid additional delays.\r\nThe
    DTX functions described in this ETS are mandatory for implementati\r\non in all
    GSM MSs. The receiver requirements are mandatory for impleme\r\nntation in all
    GSM BSSs, the transmitter requirements only for those w\r\nhere downlink DTX will
    be used.\r\nDTX shall be in operation in GSM MSs if commanded so by the network,
    s\r\nee GSM 04.08.\r\n"
