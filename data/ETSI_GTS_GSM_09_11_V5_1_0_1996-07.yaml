abstract:
- content: "The scope of this Technical Specification is to provide a detailed\r\nspecification
    for interworking between the A interface protocol and\r\nthe Mobile Application
    Part for handling of supplementary services.\r\nThe MAP interfaces of interest
    are the B-, C-, D- and E-interfaces.\r\nThe A-, C-, D- and E-interfaces are physical
    interfaces while the\r\nB-interface is an internal interface defined for modelling
    purposes.\r\nInformation relating to the modelling interface is not normative
    in\r\nthis specification.\r\nSupplementary service signalling may be passed by
    the MSC/VLR between\r\nthe A- and E-interfaces after inter-MSC handover. This
    procedure is\r\ntransparent as far as supplementary services are concerned therefore\r\ninterworking
    concerning this process is not described in this\r\nspecification.\r\nSection
    2 describes general procedures for interworking between the A-\r\nand D- physical
    interfaces.\r\nSection 3 describes the general procedures for the SS version\r\nnegotiation.\r\nSection
    4 describes the mapping of layer 3 radio path messages with\r\nTransaction Capabilities
    (TC) transaction sublayer messages for\r\ninterworking between the A- and D- physical
    interfaces.\r\nSection 5 describes specific interworking procedures for all\r\ninterfaces
    relating to call related SS activity.\r\nSection 6 describes specific interworking
    procedures for all\r\ninterfaces relating to call independent SS activity. Section
    6 also\r\ncovers the interworking between the MAP User (see TS GSM 09.02) and\r\nthe
    SS handling functions of the network entities (see TS GSM 04.10\r\nand TS GSM
    04.80).\r\n"
