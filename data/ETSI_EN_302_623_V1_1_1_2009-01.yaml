- content: 'To prepare a Harmonized EN covering the essential requirements for Mobile
    Terminal Station (TS) of Broadband Wireless Access Systems (BWA) in the Frequency
    Band 3400-3800 MHz. It is intended to cover the provisions of Directive 1999/5/EC
    (R&TTE Directive) Article 3.2, which states that: "... radio equipment shall be
    so constructed that it effectively uses the spectrum allocated to terrestrial/space
    radio communications and orbital resources so as to avoid harmful interference".
    This Work Item takes into account the technical and operational conditions identified
    in the draft TR 102 742 as well as ECC Decision(07)02.'
