abstract:
- content: 'Specification of an HbbTV terminal supporting the signalling, transport
    and presentation of an operator application that runs on this terminal and is
    able to control some of its user interfaces. The level of control over the terminal
    depends on the type of operator application that is installed on the terminal.
    This specification will use functionalities already specified in TS 102 796 which
    is describing a platform for signalling, transport, and presentation of enhanced
    and interactive applications intended for running on hybrid terminals that include
    both a DVB compliant broadcast connection and a broadband connection to the Internet.  '
