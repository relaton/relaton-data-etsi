abstract:
- content: To prepare a report that identifies the role of hardware, both specialised
    and general-purpose, in the security of AI. This will address the mitigations
    available in hardware to prevent attacks (as identified in SAI-005) and also address
    the general requirements on hardware to support SAI (expanding from SAI-004, SAI-002,
    and SAI-003). In addition this report will address possible strategies to use
    AI for protection of hardware. The report will also provide a summary of academic
    and industrial experience in hardware security for AI. In addition, the report
    will address vulnerabilities or weaknesses introduced by hardware that may amplify
    attack vectors on AI.
