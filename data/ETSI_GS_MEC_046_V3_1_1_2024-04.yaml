abstract:
- content: This Work Item introduces a new set of APIs that is devoted to the provision
    of network-connected sensorsâ€™ information and data to MEC applications. The target
    of these MEC APIs is to ease the MEC applications in collecting data from network-connected
    sensors. The MEC sensor-sharing APIs provide information about the available sensor
    types, including details about the types and the related features, and they inform
    the MEC applications how to connect to the sensors. Furthermore, they can forward
    data to MEC applications using hardware-independent data formats and interfaces.
    The information that can be shared, the procedures for requesting the information,
    and the data will be defined together with the response methods. The information
    flows, the interfaces, the data model and the format will be detailed as well.
