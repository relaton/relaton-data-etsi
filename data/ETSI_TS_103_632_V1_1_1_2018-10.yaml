  content: Specify an API which can be used by application developers to gain access
    to broadcast radio tuners in consumer electronic devices such as smartphones,
    tablets and other devices and which allow the execution of  program code often
    referred to as Apps using the Java programming language, selected because of its
    clear and well known syntax, its implementation of all necessary programming paradigms
    (e.g. Object Orientated, Generics, Data encapsulation ) and its use in the main
    target platform of possible devices, the Android platform.
