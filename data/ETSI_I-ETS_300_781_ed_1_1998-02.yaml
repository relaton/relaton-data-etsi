abstract:
- content: "This Interim European telecommunications Standard (I-ETS) applies to\r\nbalanced
    fibre branching devices to be used in single mode optical\r\ntransmission networks.
    Unbalanced fibre branching devices should also\r\nsatisfy similar mechanical and
    environmental requirements. The scope\r\nis to establish minimum uniform requirements
    for the following\r\naspects:\r\n\t- optical, environmental and mechanical properties;\r\n\t-
    test conditions;\r\n\t- acceptance criteria.\r\n Some users may have additional
    specific requirements, such as a need\r\nto verify perfprmance at lower temperatures.
    These users should\r\nspecify connectors conforming to the basic ETSI performance
    standard,\r\nplus additional tests or more severe test conditions.\r\n Acceptance
    criteria will be interpreted with respect to the condition\r\nthat some of the
    parameters specified in this I-ETS may be affected\r\nby measurement uncertainty
    arising either from measurement or\r\ncalibration errors. Test methods are in
    accordance with EN 181 000\r\nunless otherwise specified.\r\nA fibre branching
    device is : \" A passive optical component which\r\nsplits the incoming signal
    (M) to a number of outputs (N).\"\r\n "
