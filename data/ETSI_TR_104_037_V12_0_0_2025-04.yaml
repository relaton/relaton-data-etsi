  content: The present document reports potential O-RAN use cases as defined by O-RAN
    WG1 UCTG (Use Case Task Group). The use cases are described at a very high level,
    emphasizing how the use is enabled by O-RAN architecture along with basic input
    data expectations and resulting actions. These high level use cases are prioritized
    within O-RAN, and selected use cases are further detailed in O-RAN WG1 UCTG and
    relevant O-RAN WGs to define the requirements for O-RAN components and their interfaces.
