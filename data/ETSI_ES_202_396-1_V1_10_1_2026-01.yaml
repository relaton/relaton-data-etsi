  content: "-Speech quality performance in the presence of background noise reduction
    algorithms\r\n-Sound field simulation when directional microphones are used\r\n-The
    application area is hands-free terminals, mobile terminals, networks and car audio
    systems. \r\nThis revision is to include new noise recording(s) in the database
    described in clause 8. If applicable, additional requirements on the maximum distortion
    and playback level of the loudspeakers/sub-woofer used in the sound field reproduction
    will be defined based on the new recordings."
