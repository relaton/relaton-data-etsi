abstract:
- content: "The work item will investigate the advances concerning the virtualization
    of RAN and profile the NFV framework to determine how it can support vRAN use
    cases. More specifically, the work item will analyse\r\n- vRAN use cases and map
    them to the current NFV concepts supported by the NFV architectural framework.\r\n-
    the state and potential enhancements for specific capabilities to support vRAN
    use cases, such as acceleration and platform capabilities (synchronization, real-time,
    etc.).\r\n- the aspects of NFVI provisioning and HW management, and\r\n- the configuration
    of NFV-MANO and NFVI/platform in consideration of particular vRAN deployment characteristics,
    such as small but highly distributed sites.\r\nThe work item is expected to identify
    and provide recommendations for normative and/or other informative work. In the
    development of the work item, strong coordination will be promoted with relevant
    organizations such as O-RAN Alliance and 3GPP on the exchange of (potential) requirements
    and use cases. The resulting deliverable will be informative."
