  content: This standard defines a core set of features that enable multiple subscriber
    devices to gain access to operator provided high-speed data service independently
    of the underlying access network. This core set of features allows for both IPv4-
    and IPv6-enabled devices to gain connectivity to the Internet. The core set of
    features defined in this standard includes the ability to provision multiple CPE
    devices, a description of how to forward data to and from CPE devices, and also
    the ability to forward IP multicast traffic to and among CPE devices.
