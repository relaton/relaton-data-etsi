abstract:
- content: "This Technical Report (TR) contains the results obtained from an internationally
    co-ordinated subjective evaluation conducted by four laboratories to estimate
    the performance in mobile-to-mobile connections of the GSM half, full, and enhanced
    full rate speech codecs (including the expected advantages of the Tandem Free
    Operation), in case of inter-operability in the digital cellular telecommunications
    system. These (listening-only) tests did not include the effects of Voice Activity
    Detector, Comfort Noise Insertion and the Discontinuous Transmission.\r\n"
