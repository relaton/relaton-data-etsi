  content: "ISG CCM will facilitate the smooth transition between todays television\r\nstandards
    and tomorrows with the definition of a new transmission\r\nsystem able to offer
    backwards compatibility with todays television\r\nstandards whilst also providing
    the full quality for the next generation High\r\nDynamic Range (HDR) and Wider
    Colour Gamut (WCG) televisions.\r\n The requirement to not compromise the quality
    of the legacy signal using\r\ntodays displays but yet to provide the highest quality
    HDR/WCG quality\r\nsignal for a new generation of televisions is onerous and requires
    analysis\r\nto develop an optimal solution.\r\nThe group will specify the technology
    needed and ensure that the creative\r\nintent embedded into both legacy and HDR/WCG
    content is preserved and\r\npropagated through the appropriate interfaces"
