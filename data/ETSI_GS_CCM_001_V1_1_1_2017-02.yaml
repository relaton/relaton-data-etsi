abstract:
- content: "ISG CCM will facilitate the smooth transition between today’s television\r\nstandards
    and tomorrow’s with the definition of a new transmission\r\nsystem able to offer
    backwards compatibility with today’s television\r\nstandards whilst also providing
    the full quality for the next generation High\r\nDynamic Range (HDR) and Wider
    Colour Gamut (WCG) televisions.\r\n– The requirement to not compromise the quality
    of the legacy signal using\r\ntoday’s displays but yet to provide the highest
    quality HDR/WCG quality\r\nsignal for a new generation of televisions is onerous
    and requires analysis\r\nto develop an optimal solution.\r\nThe group will specify
    the technology needed and ensure that the creative\r\nintent embedded into both
    legacy and HDR/WCG content is preserved and\r\npropagated through the appropriate
    interfaces"
