abstract:
- content: "The scope of the Content Delivery Infrastructures work item is to assess
    the domain of  Content Delivery Infrastructures, to identify and classify existing
    or upcoming solutions and the related standards. The scope should cover Internet
    Content Distribution as well as operator content distribution in fixed and mobile
    scenarii and remain architecture-neutral to best serve the largest possible set
    of target architectures.\r\nThe goal of this document is not to provide a specification,
    but it can precise what constraints the generality goal will impose on specifications.
    The report should pay attention to the work already started in this domain outside
    MCD and indicate their suitability to the specified objectives.\r\n"
