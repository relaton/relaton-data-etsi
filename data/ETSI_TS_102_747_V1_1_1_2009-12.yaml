  content: "The work will build on results from STF265 on User Profile Management.
    With the goal of obtaining maximum benefits for users, profiles would not be limited
    to cover today's ICT market, but would also embrace ubiquitous services and applications,
    and be able to communicate with a wide range of devices in digital homes/buildings.
    \r\nThe deliverable will be a Technical Specification (TS) on issues related to
    networks, terminals and SmartCards. The intended readers of this deliverable are
    profile providers, telecom companies and device manufacturers who will implement
    and provide the underlying infrastructure and architecture of network and devices
    necessary to achieve the user profile management concept described in EG 202 325
    Human Factors (HF); User Profile Management."
