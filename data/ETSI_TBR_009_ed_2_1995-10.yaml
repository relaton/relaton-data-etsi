abstract:
- content: "This Technical Basis for Regulation (TBR) specifies the technical\r\nrequirements
    to be provided by terminal equipment capable of\r\nconnection to a public telecommunications
    network. These requirements\r\napply to terminals for phase 1 of the public land
    mobile radio service\r\nutilising constant envelope modulation, operating in the
    900 MHz band\r\nwith a channel separation of 200 kHz, and carrying 8 full rate
    traffic\r\nchannels per carrier according to the Time Division Multiple Access\r\n(TDMA)
    principle.\r\nThis TBR covers the requirements for GSM Telephony (speech).\r\nNOTE:
    Certain access aspects are part of TBR 5 [7].\r\nFor each conformance requirement,
    one or more test purposes are given.\r\nFor each test purpose, a single reference
    is given to the test method\r\nin GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2]. The requirements
    apply to speech\r\ntransmission.\r\nThe measurement uncertainty is handled, as
    described in GSM 11.10\r\n(I-ETS 300 020-1) [2].\r\nThis TBR covers the essential
    requirements of the Terminal Directive\r\n91/263/EEC [1] Article 4g. Articles
    4d, 4e and 4f are covered by TBR 5\r\n[7].\r\nThe Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC
    [1] Articles 4a and 4b are covered\r\nby other directives, and, therefore, not
    by this TBR.\r\nIn this TBR, there are no EMC technical requirements in terms
    of the\r\nTerminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1], Article 4c.\r\nNOTE: Technical Requirments
    for EMC performance and testing of the\r\nequipment are covered by the relevant
    standards applicable to the EMC\r\nDirective 89/336/EEC, Annex A.\r\nTerminal
    equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other\r\nCommon Technical
    Regulations (CTR) depending on the equipments\r\nfunctionality.\r\nGSM 11.10 (I-ETS
    300 020-1) [2] constitutes the full conformance test\r\nsuite for GSM. The verification
    of the conformance requirements in\r\nthis TBR ame based on the tests described
    in this reference. The set\r\nof requirements in GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2]
    and the set of\r\nrequirements in this TBR need not be identical.\r\n "
