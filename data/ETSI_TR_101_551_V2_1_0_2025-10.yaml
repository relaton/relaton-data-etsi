  content: "This Technical Report (TR) provides guidance to contracting authorities
    on how to determine contract award criteria to meet the accessibility requirements
    of Directive (EU) 2019/882 (European Accessibility Act) and Directive (EU)2016/2102
    (Web Accessibility Directive, WAD); and on how to verify the conformance of publicly
    procured ICT products and services with these requirements. \r\nThe present document
    describes how the accessibility requirements for the procured ICT should be specified,
    documented and assessed in the frame of the procurement process, under the EU
    Public Procurement Directives. The different mechanisms for conformity assessment
    with the applicable accessibility requirements are explained. It is discussed
    how these mechanisms may be applied both in the pre-procurement research phase
    and when awarding a contract, as well as part of contract management in the post-award
    stage. \r\nThe Technical Report also provides a useful guidance for bidders who
    prepare and offer for public procurement of ICT products and services, and others
    aiming to procure accessible ICT. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the work item is the
    revision of CEN/CLC/ETSI TR 101551:2014 \"Guidelines on the use of accessibility
    award criteria suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in
    Europe\", and of CEN/CLC/ETSI TR 101 552:2014 \"Guidance for the application of
    conformity assessment to accessibility requirements for public procurement of
    ICT products and services in Europe\", to support to the European Accessibility
    Act (Directive 2019/882), as indicated in the Standardisation Request (SR) M:587.
    Both documents support EN 301 549: 2011 \"Accessibility requirements for ICT products
    and services. M/587 explicitly states that \"these technical reports could be
    combined in their revision\". \r\nM/587 also indicates that \"it is important
    to facilitate the use by stakeholders of the revised harmonised standard EN 301
    549 in support of Directive (EU) 2019/882 and Directive (EU) 2016/2102. To that
    end hte ESOs should (...) update the technical reports CEN/CLC/ETSI TR 101551:2014,
    and CEN/CLC/ETSI TR 101 552:2014 to reflect the content of the revised harmonised
    standards resulting from this request.\" \r\nThe aim of the revision of those
    Technical Reports (TRs) is: \r\n- to support the implementation of Directive 2019/882
    (European Accessibility Act, EAA);\r\n- to align the TR with the current Public
    Procurement Directive; \r\n- to align the TR with the ongoing revision of EN 301
    549 \r\n- to facilitate the use by stakeholders of the revised harmonised standards
    EN 301 549 in the procurement process in support of Directive (EU) 2019/882 and
    Directive (EU) 2016/2102. \r\n\r\nDeliverable prepared by a CEN/CENELEC Project
    Team (PT) under the CEN/CENELEC/ETSI Joint Working Group (JWG) on eAccessibility.
    The drafting rules of CEN/CENELEC apply. Joint copyright of the 3 ESOs."
