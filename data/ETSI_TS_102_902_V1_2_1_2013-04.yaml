  content: The work being undertaken with the railways by STF 397 has greatly improved
    their understanding of the requirements for co-existence with ER-GSM. As a result
    it is considered that parts of TS 102 902 are now obsolete. Since the document
    is being widely circulated within ECC, it is important that the contents are updated
    as soon as reasonably possible.
