abstract:
- content: "This work item to amend the former version of EN 302 065 Part 3, v2.1.1
    (“Requirements for UWB devices for ground based vehicular applications”) to address
    the request of the EU desk officer. This includes a detailed description of the
    wanted performance criterion, RX-requirements and fixed limits for all requirements
    based on a clear test procedure.\r\nTherefore, this EN will cover vehicle installed
    devices for “UWB based vehicular access systems for operation in 6 GHz to 8,5
    GHz frequency ranges”, using “Trigger-before-Transmit” mitigation technique. It
    applies to Category A (proximity verification) and Category B (proximity monitoring)
    systems as introduced in TR 103 416 V1.1.1 respectively ECC Report 278.\r\nA first
    collection of open points which shall be considered (in addition) are uploaded
    as: TGUWB[17]040001 and TGUWB(17)040007\r\n"
