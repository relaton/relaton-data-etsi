abstract:
- content: "Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC) networks are a sub-class of Cable Television (CATV)
    networks in which the subscribers are divided into groups by using optical transmission
    technology in the trunk network.\r\nThe CATV infrastructures can support the implementation
    of the Return Channel for interactive services suitable for DVB broadcasting systems.
    CATV can be used to implement interactive services in the DVB environment, providing
    a bi-directional communication path between the user terminal and the service
    provider."
