abstract:
- content: "EAP is a general authentication framework, which supports multiple authentication
    methods and is widely used in multiple technologies and contexts.\r\nIn this context,
    this Work Item aims to produce the necessary outputs to  run EAP on the UICC and
    to provide mechanisms to:\r\n-Enable any UICC application to carry out a particular
    Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method.\r\n-Provide the required link
    between the supplicant software in the terminal EAP layer and this specific UICC
    application.\r\nSecurity issues of this work item will be done in close cooperation
    with SCP WG2."
