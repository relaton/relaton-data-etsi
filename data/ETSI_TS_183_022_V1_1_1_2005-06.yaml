  content: "This document describes an extension to H.248.1 gateway protocol to enable
    a Call Agent / MGC to store data on a MG that can be subsequently retrieved to
    facilitate MGC recovery action. \r\nThe standard H248 audit mechanism permits
    a MGC to retrieve data from an associated MG in order to resynchronise connection
    data/state between a MGC and MG. In terms of identifying the other end of this
    connection, the SDP RD (Remote Descriptor) that is associated with the ephemeral
    termination MAY enable the other end of the connection to be identified - albeit
    not in a format that may be convenient for the MGC to use. In many cases the RD
    may not enable the other end to be identified (e.g. some GWs may use different
    control and media addresses)."
