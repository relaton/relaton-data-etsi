  content: The work item shall evaluate existing user-centred guidelines and their
    dissemination for the development of real-time communication services.  This includes
    EG 202 534 and the web-based system developed by STF284 (DEG/HF-00062).  The real-time
    services shall include person-to-person communication (e.g., multimedia conferencing,
    text communication) and person-machine interaction (e.g. machine avatars,  mobile
    TV).  Future requirements shall be derived from industry consultation and shall
    identify the priorities for new guideline data beyond that currently available.  Recommendations
    shall be made that take into account the evolution of technologies, the development
    of user and market requirements and updates of the EC ICT Standardisation Work
    Programme.
