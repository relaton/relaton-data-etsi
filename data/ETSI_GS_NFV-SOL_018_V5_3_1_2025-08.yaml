  content: "This revision of NFV-SOL 018 continues the development of the specification
    as part of the NFV Release 5. This edition will extend the specification of protocol
    and data models to support the Release 5 features. The scope of the former edition
    is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nThe work item provides a mapping of the NFV object
    model for OS container management and orchestration to managed objects of Kubernetes
    and Helm(TM) as specified by the CNCF along with a specification of a mapping
    between a common set of input parameters (e.g., derived from VNFD/NSD and/or NFV-MANO
    RESTful APIs) and output parameters associated to the management and orchestration
    of the referred managed objects.\r\nIt profiles the reference Kubernetes API,
    Helm(TM) documentation and Docker(TM) registry API as NFV protocol and data model
    solution for OS container management and orchestration, OS container workload
    based on an MCIOP, OS container image management, CIS instance management and
    management of Managed CIS Cluster Objects (MCCO). \r\nThe latest published versions
    of the reference Kubernetes API, Helm(TM) documentation and Docker(TM) registry
    API are profiled against the requirements on the functions and the management
    service interfaces of the Container Infrastructure Service Management (CISM) and
    Container Image Registry (CIR) functions as specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040,
    ETSI GS NFV-IFA 036 and ETSI GS NFV-IFA 010. \r\nThe work item includes guidelines
    and rules on how the profiled and referenced solutions can be adopted in a way
    that facilitates their integration with NFV-MANO framework solutions. The resulting
    deliverable will contain normative provisions."
