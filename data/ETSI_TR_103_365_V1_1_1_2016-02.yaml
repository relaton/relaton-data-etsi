  script: Latn
  content: "Based on TS-102883 the targeted TR shall describe a time domain based
    procedure for the Peak Power measurement. It shall be applicable to all UWB signals
    types and shall be an improvement to the shortcomings of the current measurement
    procedure (accurate results, no overestimation due to worst-case correction factors).\r\nThe
    developed measurement procedure in the time domain should lead to measurement
    results which are equivalent to the results obtained in the frequency domain measurements.\r\n"
