abstract:
- content: "To investigate the possibilities of integrating the functionalities of\r\nthe
    DECT and GSM parts of dual-mode terminals further than is done in\r\nthe first
    edition of TBR 39.This includes e.g. the issues of having\r\nboth modes active
    simultaneously, swapping of the higher layers and\r\nhandover between the modes.
    Also network aspects of the use of\r\nadvanced dual-mode terminals is considered.\r\nThe
    same consideration should be made for dual-mode terminals and\r\ninfrastructure
    for DECT/DCS1800 as well as triple-mode terminals\r\nDECT/GSM/DCS1800.\r\n The
    need for further standardization should be identified, especially\r\nthe contents
    of an eventual ETS as the basis for the second edition of\r\nTBR 39.\r\n "
