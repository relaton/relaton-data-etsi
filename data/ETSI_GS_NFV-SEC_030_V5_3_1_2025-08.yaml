abstract:
- content: The present document defines the security assurance of VNFM products, which
    is part of NFV-MANO system. The outcome of this WI expects the security assets,
    security threats, security requirements and test cases for evaluating the security
    of VNFM products. In this work item, the security assurance methodology introduced
    in 3GPP specifications will be leveraged. Security test cases including testing
    goals, testing steps, and evidence of testing results will be produced for evaluating
    whether the security requirements are implemented by VNFM based products. In this
    version tests will be added to cover VNFM certificate management in delegation
    mode.
