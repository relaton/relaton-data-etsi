  content: "The SRDoc will review the operational and the sharing requirements of
    ITS G5 systems operating in the 5,9GHz band. Mitigation factors shall be identified
    optimizing the coexistence behavior of ITS G5 system and potential victim systems.\r\nThe
    SRDoc should already include initial sharing investigation based on simulations."
