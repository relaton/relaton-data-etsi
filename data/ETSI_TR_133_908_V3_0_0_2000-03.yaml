abstract:
- content: "Description of the work undertaken by SAGE Task Force for the design of
    the standard 3GPP Confidentiality and Integrity Algorithms (SAGE TF 3GPP), and
    to formally approve the release of these algorithms to 3GPP.\r\nWith regard to
    the design of the algorithms, the scope of the present document is confined to
    a description of the design criteria, the design methodology and an outline of
    the content and structure of the specification and test data documents.\r\nThe
    standard 3GPP Confidentiality and Integrity Algorithms are based on a Block Cipher
    named KASUMI. The algorithms specification and associated test data are documented
    in the Specification of the 3GPP Confidentiality and Integrity Algorithms which
    consists of the following four documents:\r\n-Specification of the 3GPP Confidentiality
    and Integrity Algorithms; Document 1: f8 and f9 specifications (TS 35.201).\r\n-Specification
    of the 3GPP Confidentiality and Integrity Algorithms; Document 2: KASUMI algorithm
    specification (TS 35.202).\r\n-Specification of the 3GPP Confidentiality and Integrity
    Algorithms; Document 3: Implementors' test data (TS 35.203).\r\n-Specification
    of the 3GPP Confidentiality and Integrity Algorithms; Document 4: Design conformance
    test data (TS 35.204).\r\nWith regard to the evaluation of the algorithm, the
    scope of this report is restricted to a description of the evaluation criteria,
    the method of evaluation and the main conclusions from the evaluation that led
    to the Task Force approving the specification. A detailed summary of conclusions
    of the evaluation is provided in a public evaluation report [3] produced by the
    Task Force.\r\n"
