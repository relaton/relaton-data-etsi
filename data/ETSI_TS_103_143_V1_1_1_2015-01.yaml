  content: This technical specification defines the system architecture for the information
    exchange between different Geo-location Databases (GLDBs) enabling the operation
    of White Space Devices (WSDs) for the protection of the incumbent service. The
    architecture stems from the system requirements described in the section 7.1 (Terrestrial
    Broadcasting Service Protection Requirements) of ETSI TS 102 946 System requirements
    for operation in UHF TV Band White Spaces and will serve as an input for defining
    the Harmonized Standards and European Standards that are part of the EC mandate
    for Reconfigurable Radio Systems (M/512).
