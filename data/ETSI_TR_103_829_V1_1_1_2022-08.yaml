abstract:
- content: "The present document serves as a guide for policy makers, communication
    service providers and law enforcement agencies, regarding the retention of IP
    addresses for law enforcement purposes.\r\n The study considers and documents:\r\n1.
    \   Basic Internet protocol principles, highlighting specifically how IP addresses
    and ports are used to access the internet.\r\n2.    Key differences between IPv4,
    IPv6, Dual Stack and other relevant layer 3 protocols.\r\n3.    How IP addresses
    are allocated within networks, including EPC and 5GC, documenting any differences
    in approach.\r\n4.    The role of Network and Port address translation within
    a CSP network.\r\n5.    The impact address translation technologies on IP address
    attribution as observed from outside the CSPs network. This includes a discussion
    on the different translation technologies commonly used by CSPs (e.g. NAT, PAT,
    CGNAT, NAT64).\r\n6.    Description of the key elements which define user and
    IP address association and therefore make up the minimal set of stored attributes
    for a viable IP retention solution.\r\n7.    Methods for accessing records of
    IP and Port allocation from within a CSP network.\r\n8.   Methods for retaining
    and querying stored IP association records, consideration is given to the storage
    volumes, durations and accuracy requirements.\r\n"
