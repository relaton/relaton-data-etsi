abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the PICS proforma, the Abstract test suite\r\n(ATS)
    and the partial Protocol Implementation eXtra Information for\r\nTesting (PIXIT)
    proforma for the network side of the T reference point\r\nor coincident S and
    T reference point for the pan-European Integrated\r\nServices Digital Network
    (ISDN) as provided by European public\r\ntelecomunications operators by means
    of the Digital subscriber\r\nSignalling System No. one (DSS1) protocol, for Network
    Integration\r\nTesting (NIT) covering the end-to-end support of ISDN services.\r\nThe
    pan-European ISDN is made up by connecting the different national\r\nnetworks
    and End-to-end NIT covers all the testing activities\r\nnecessary to access the
    correct behaviour of the interconnected\r\nnetwork from the point of view of access
    interfaces, network side.\r\nBoth bearer services (and associated teleservices)
    and supplementary\r\nservices are checked for interworking capability and compatibility,
    in\r\nthe pan-European ISDN.\t\r\n"
