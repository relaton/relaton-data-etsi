  content: This Technical Specification defines the content of the LSA Spectrum Resource
    Availability Information (LSRAI) and the protocols on the interface between LSA
    Controller (LC) and LSA Repository (LR), the so-called LSA1. Both, the LSRAI content
    and the LSA1 protocols, have been identified as standardisation candidates following
    the TC RRS work flow recommendation (Protocol and Interfaces Specification (TS)).
    The work will be based on the System Requirements defined in ETSI TS 103 154 (System
    requirements for operation of Mobile Broadband Systems in the 2 300 MHz - 2 400
    MHz band under Licensed Shared Access (LSA)) and the System Architecture and High
    Level Procedures defined in ETSI TS 103 235 (RRS Reconfigurable Radio Systems
    (RRS); System Architecture and High Level Procedures for operation of Licensed
    Shared Access (LSA) in the 2300 MHz-2400 MHz band). Application to other bands
    is not precluded and depends on future regulatory decisions.
