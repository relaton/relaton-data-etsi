  content: "Derived from the past deliverables (e.g. INF005, EVE005 and IFA022), this
    work item will report about issues when it comes to fulfilling VNF networking
    requirements with the NFV framework. The work item will analyse the integration
    and operation for virtual networking and SDN usage. Recent advances available
    in networking infrastructure will be considered in the study. Areas of study include
    interactions on the [NF-Vi]/N, network provisioning across network domain boundaries,
    efficient interworking of overlay and underlay network provisioning, and management
    and operations for Connectivity Service with recent traffic engineering technologies.\r\nThe
    deliverable will collect use cases and, based on them, recommendations on normative
    work will be made.The deliverable will be informative.\r\n"
