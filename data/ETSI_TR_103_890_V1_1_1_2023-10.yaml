  content: "The present document provides information on designing generic OTT clients
    based on most commonly used codec/client technology (standardised, open source)
    to enable an on device, fully controllable testing of a single OTT voice client
    version using a fully accessible KPIs set. The present document provides a framework
    for validating the generic solution against real live applications. \r\nTopics
    studied: \r\n-Use cases to be covered: OTT voice conversational\r\n-Analysis of
    error patterns in different network conditions based on which client settings
    are defined within the context of each use case, type of OTT application\r\n-Jitter
    buffer handling tunning/testing/validation (using time series and quality prediction
    scores) running generic buffer simultaneously with real app. Jitter buffer / client
    within the context of each use case, type of OTT application\r\n-Framework/rules
    for data driven proof that generic mimic the real apps\r\n"
