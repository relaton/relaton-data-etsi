abstract:
- content: "In direct correspondence with the following ICT  Standardization Action:
    Identification of interoperability gaps in existing and emerging international/European
    Grid standards: an inventory and analysis shall be made across the range of involved
    standards - making bodies with a view to determining the shortcomings; overlaps
    and loopholes in current and proposed de facto Grid standards at all levels of
    the middleware/protocol stack (network to application interfaces).\r\nThis is
    part 1 of a 2 part document providing a study of ICT GRID interoperability gaps.
    This document captures the current state of the Grid and will identify the key
    stakeholders, including standards making bodies, research projects, production
    Grids and other initiatives. It will also identify a recommended base of standards
    and de-facto standards taking into account the needs of interoperability."
