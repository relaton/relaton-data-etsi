abstract:
- content: This work item will analyse and define the type of OAM functions for VNFs
    that can be generalized and be provided as a “generic function” supporting the
    provisioning, connectivity, configuration and monitoring of VNFs on a virtualized
    platform. The work item will also determine possible solutions to realize such
    generic OAM functions, e.g., by leveraging PaaS capabilities.  The result report
    will include, if necessary, recommendations for requirements and architectural
    enhancements. The resulting deliverable will be informative.
