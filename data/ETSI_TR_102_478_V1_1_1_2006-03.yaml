  content: "This Technical Report identifies key use cases for communication with
    or between IP-based Next Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN) involving public
    next generation networks (NGN), analyses these use cases in terms of available
    or planned standardised technology and identifies requirements that will have
    to be met. \r\nThis Technical Report investigates configurations involving NGCNs
    and NGNs and their interoperating requirements. Non-IP-based interoperation, i.e.
    using circuit-switched technology, between NGCNs and NGNs is outside the scope
    of this Technical Report. \r\nThis Technical Report does not discriminate between
    wireless and wired access technology. \r\nAll mobility aspects and. application
    considerations such as IP Centrex and CSTA (Computer Supported Telecommunications
    Applications) are outside the scope of this Technical Report"
