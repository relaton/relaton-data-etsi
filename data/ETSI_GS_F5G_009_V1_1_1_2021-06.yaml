  content: "This Work Item specifies a framework for use within ETSI ISG F5G to coordinate
    \ public demonstrations of Proof of Concepts (PoC) validating key technical components
    developed in F5G. The PoC is not an interoperability or conformance testing activity.
    The objective for the PoCs is to build awareness and confidence in the F5G standard.
    The primary goal of a PoC is to foster the development of an open ecosystem by
    integrating components from different players. \r\n\r\nThe PoC framework document
    outlines the rationale for PoCs, the PoC process, the submission format for PoC
    proposals, the review and acceptance criteria of PoC proposals, the PoC report
    format and requirements, and the ETSI support for PoC teams.\r\n"
