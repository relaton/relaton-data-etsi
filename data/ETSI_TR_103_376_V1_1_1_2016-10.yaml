  content: "The scope is:\r\nStarting from the use case families selected for the
    IoT Large Scale Pilots (LSPs)\r\nthis technical report aim is:\r\n- to provide
    the collection of all missing functionalities that have been identified in standards
    bodies (SDOs) to offer solutions addressing the use case requirements.\r\n- to
    check that there are no omissions in the standardization activity with regard
    to the use cases. In particular, gaps with respect to the framework as identified
    by oneM2M should be identified.\r\n- to propose some recommendations to overcome
    potential gaps. Particular attention will be paid on horizontal application layer
    standardisation and to assure an interworking framework among different vertical
    industrial segments.\r\n"
