abstract:
- content: "    Identify possible standardisation activities in this area by compiling
    material on the following subjects: H.323 / B-ISDN unseparated interworking via
    gateway (including voice-only, H.321 and H.310), taking into account H.246; H.323
    / B-ISDN separated interworking via gateway; Application of separated protocols
    to gatekeeper-to-gatekeeper communication; Connection of remote H.323 environments
    via B-ISDN; Future enhancement and use of annex C. Co-existence of H.323 annex
    C and B-ISDN signalling in the same network. Impact of H.323 on future mobility
    protocols. For each of above, the following topics should be addressed, where
    appropriate: Security implications; Addressing impact (including use of IP addressing);
    Conferencing models; T.120 data impact; Basic call, GFP and supplementary services;
    End-to-end resource/session level protocols. The work should identify: Possible
    work items to be addressed in H.323. Possible work items to be addressed in B-ISDN
    signalling.\r\n\r\nSupporting organisations Siemens AG, Bosch Telecom, BT, Lucent
