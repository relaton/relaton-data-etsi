  content: "This RTS will allow to cover maintenance and essential corrections to
    the M2M interfaces, by means of Change Requests, based on TS 102 921 v121. This
    work shall not include new features.\r\n\r\nThe 3 mentioned interfaces are expected
    to have commonalities in term of stage 3 definition, so one single TS is currently
    envisaged, but the possible split (one TS for each interface) will be evaluated
    when this specification will become stable."
