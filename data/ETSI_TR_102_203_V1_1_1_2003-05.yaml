  content: "The objective of this task is to define a general architecture of a mobile
    signature web service. The first step is to identify the business requirements
    that will lead the specifications. The second step is to settle a generic model
    description in order to clarify the actors and the message flows involved. \r\nRoaming
    and interoperability issues (including issues related to number portability) must
    be presented as an introduction to the Task 4 which aims rather at providing recommendations
    for interoperability. \r\nA review of the current initiatives must be done so
    that the work should be done in co-ordination with bodies in the domain of electronic
    signature, particularly in Europe. However, liaison with other organisations outside
    Europe should also be taken into consideration. An initial list of interested
    bodies is: M-Sign, Radicchio, GSM Association, WAP Forum."
