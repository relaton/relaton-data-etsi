abstract:
- content: "The present document provides test methodologies for the subjective assessment
    of disturbances caused by echo control systems in speech communication devices.
    The listening test design takes the self-hearing of the far-end talker into account,
    which influences the assessment of perceived degradation.\r\nAdapted test procedures
    for single- and double-talk scenarios as well as a reference system with controlled
    degradation are taken into account.\r\nIn addition, guidelines for the recording
    and preparation of listening test stimuli are provided."
