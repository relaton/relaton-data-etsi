  content: The WI is to provide maintenance to the TS 185 009 document defining the
    overall architecture of the customer network device (CND) enabling the IPTV service
    consumption. The architectural definition will cover both transport and service
    layer related functionalities. The interfaces between the CND and other elements
    of the customer premises network (CPN), such as the Customer Network Gateway (CNG),
    and other customer network devices will be also specified. The activity will be
    carried out on the basis of the stage 1 and stage 2/3 specifications related to
    IPTV and produced by WG1, WG2 and WG3 and will be applicable to IMS based IPTV
    service layer architecture.
