  content: "EN 305 174-2 specifies a minimum set of required practices for energy
    management which are applicable to ICT sites of all sizes and business models.
    \ These are taken from a sub-set of those practices recommended by CLC/TR 50600-99-1.
    \r\n CLC/TR 50600-99-1 also contains a much wider range of recommended practices
    which are applicable to specific designs of ICT site and may be applied to improve
    the energy management beyond the minimum requirements of EN 305 174-2. \r\n The
    present document: \r\n- maps the practices of CLC/TR 50600-99-1 to general application
    of EN 305 174-2 and also to the specific design options which may apply in a given
    ICT site; \r\n- details examples of the impact of such practices in relation to
    reductions in energy consumption or improvements in energy efficiency or management.
    \ \r\n\r\n In addition, the present document addresses the end-of-life and maintenance
    aspects of WEEE (as in EN 305 174-8 and TS 105 174-8)."
