  content: "This work item will provide a framework to build  key encapsulation mechanisms
    (KEMs) retaining both pre- and post-quantum securities through hybridization,
    with additional features for practical uses, while being efficient enough for
    browser or mobile use: namely, keys will be encapsulated with respect to user-attribute
    subset covers, the encapsulations will be anonymous, and any user having attributes
    fulfilling the encapsulation policy will be able retrieve the keys, while those
    who do not fit the policy will not have this possibility. As many users could
    have the same attributes, one can also wish for an additional tracing feature,
    in which a tracing authority could have means to distinguish users with the same
    attributes. \r\nIt will also explain how such a KEM can be combined with a secure
    data encapsulation mechanism (DEM) to provide a secure public-key encryption scheme
    in the KEM-DEM paradigm from [Shoup01], and other useful applications, such as
    in anonymous authentication contexts.\r\n"
