  content: "Complete restructuring of the EN as complementary EN to Part 2-2. Reporting
    only the requirements considered not essential for R&TTED (e.g. BBER and signatures),
    for special compatibility (e.g. innermost channels masks and RX selectivity when
    common branching/antenna is used), for good design practice (e.g. antenna and
    feeder return loss, RX level range)\r\nEffort will be done for substituting band
    specific masks and signatures with parametric requirements (e.g. NFD or similar
    residual power in RX bandwidth) so as to possibly remove Annexes A to E (moving
    the so generalised requirements in the main body)."
