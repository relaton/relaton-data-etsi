abstract:
- content: "Complete restructuring of the EN as “complementary” EN to Part 2-2. Reporting
    only the requirements considered “not essential” for R&TTED (e.g. BBER and signatures),
    for “special compatibility” (e.g. innermost channels masks and RX selectivity
    when common branching/antenna is used), for “good design practice” (e.g. antenna
    and feeder return loss, RX level range)\r\nEffort will be done for substituting
    band specific masks and signatures with parametric requirements (e.g. NFD or similar
    residual power in RX bandwidth) so as to possibly remove Annexes A to E (moving
    the so “generalised” requirements in the main body)."
