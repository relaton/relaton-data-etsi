    for Testing Manager. The scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:
    \r\n\r\nNFV-IFA 049 specifies:  \r\nRegarding the VNF generic OAM functions and
    other PaaS Services, it specifies the functional requirements and the interface
    requirements for VNF generic OAM functions and other PaaS Services. Specification
    of the interfaces exposed by the VNF generic OAM functions and other PaaS Services,
    and the relevant information models are also provided, like also a description
    of requirements and modelling of descriptors of PaaS Services, with specific additional
    requirements for VNF generic OAM functions. \r\n\r\nRegarding the PaaS Service
    management, it specifies interface requirements of interfaces produced by the
    PSM and PSR (as functionally specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 010), and their interface
    operations and associated information modelling."
