abstract:
- content: "This multi-part deliverable provides technical specifications for helping
    implementers and accelerating the development of ASiC containers creation and
    validation applications. The test results may also be used in conformity assessment
    for signature creation and validation applications (EN 19 103) with policies requiring
    conformity to ASiC formats and procedures.\r\nFirst, it will define test suites
    as complete as possible for supporting the organization of interoperability testing
    events where different ASiC related applications may check their actual interoperability.
    Additionally, it will include the\r\nspecifications required for building software
    tools for actually testing technical compliance of ASiC against the relevant ASiC
    related technical specifications.\r\nPart 2 will be used by entities interested
    in testing tools that generate and verify ASiC not adhered to any specific profile,
    but compliant with the mother ASiC\r\nspecification as defined in EN 19 162.\r\nA
    first version of this document was published by ETSI in March 2012. It will be
    reviewed and updated if considered worth in the view of comments arrived and the
    outcome of ASiC interoperability test events conducted before its consolidation."
