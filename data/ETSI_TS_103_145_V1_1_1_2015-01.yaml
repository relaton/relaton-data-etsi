abstract:
- content: "This technical specification defines the system architecture for the use
    of spectrum by White Space Devices (WSDs), specifically in the UHF TV Bands. The
    architecture stems from ETSI TS 102 946:  “System requirements for Operation in
    UHF TV Band White Spaces.”  The scope of the work will be to define the architecture
    of a system which can allow operation of WSDs based on information obtained from
    Geo-location databases.  The architecture will consider both uncoordinated use
    of White Space (where there is no attempt to manage the usage of channels by different
    WSDs) as well as coordinated use of White Space (where some form of channel management
    and/or coexistence techniques are employed to efficiently use the White Space).
    \ The architecture will serve as an input for defining the Harmonized Standards
    and European Standards that are part of the EC mandate for Reconfigurable Radio
    Systems (M/512).    The specification should include, but is not limited to: \r\n-
    Common architecture covering both coordinated and non-coordinated usage\r\n- Identification
    of the different entities, reference points, and the function of each entity \r\n-
    Mechanisms forHigh level procedures and signalling enabling interference management,
    coexistence, and channel management in the case of coordinated usage (including
    the evaluation of the spectrum and the coordination strategy among different CRS)\r\n-
    \ Definition, high level procedures and Information exchange for spectrum requests
    made by secondary systems\r\n- Definition, high level procedures, and information
    exchange related to measurements required for spectrum allocation and reconfiguration"
