abstract:
- content: Instantiation of the Reference Model for Autonomic Networking, Cognition
    and Self-Management onto the architecture defined in ETSI TS 123 401 and TS 123
    402, by superimposing GANA Decision Elements (DEs) into node/device architectures
    and the overall network architecture, so that the DEs and their associated Control-Loops
    can be further designed to perform autonomic management and control of the specific
    resources (Managed Entities) in the target architecture. Recommendations on the
    basic behaviours of the GANA Functional Blocks (FBs) in the above context will
    be developed. 3GPP specifications on policy control (TS 123 203) and network management
    will be taken into account (TS 123 32x series).
