  content: "This final draft European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) applies to\r\nOptical
    Amplifier (OA) devices and sub-systems to be used in\r\ntransmission networks.
    It covers both Optical Fibre Amplifiers (OFAs)\r\nand Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers
    (SOAs).\r\n This ETS specifies those generic characteristics\r\nrelevant for the
    use of OA devices (as power amplifiers,\r\npre-amplifiers or line amplifiers)
    and OA sub-systems (as optically\r\namplified transmitters or optically amplified
    receivers), primarily\r\nfor applications in digital transmission.\r\n NOTE 1:\tAs
    far as OFAs are concerned, the present ETS has been\r\nprepared from experience
    with Erbium-doped, silica-based fibre\r\namplifiers, operating in the 1 550 nm
    wavelength region. Future OFAs,\r\nbased on different active fibres and possibly
    operating in different\r\nwavelength regions, are not intended to be excluded
    from this ETS and\r\nmay lead to additional specifications, as well as to modifications
    of\r\nthe existing ones.\r\n NOTE 2:\tThe OFA aspects of the present ETS are mainly
    based on ITU-T\r\nRecommendations G.661 and G.662.\r\n"
