abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies technical characteristics and methods of
    measurements for wideband SRD terminal node equipment which communicates with
    network access point. \r\nThis radio equipment type is capable of operating in
    the designated frequency bands for wideband data transmission devices including
    \ 863 MHz to 868 MHz and 917.4 MHz to 919.4 MHz .\r\nNOTE: The relationship between
    the present document and essential requirements of article 3.2 of Directive 2014/53/EU
