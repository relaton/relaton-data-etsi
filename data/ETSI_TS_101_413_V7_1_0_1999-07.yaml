abstract:
- content: "This ETSI Technical Specification defines the stage one description of
    the SIM API. Stage one is an overall service description, primarily from the point
    of view of the SIM-ME Interface, and does not deal with the implementation details
    of the API.\r\nThis TS includes information applicable to network operators, service
    providers and terminal, SIM, switch and database manufacturers.\r\nThis TS contains
    the core requirements for a a which are sufficient to provide a complete service.\r\nIt
    is highly desirable however, that technical solutions for a Subscriber Identity
    Module Application Programming Interface (SIM API) should be sufficiently flexible
    to allow for possible enhancements. Additional functionalities not documented
    in this TS may implement requirements which are considered outside the scope of
    this TS. This additional functionality may be on a network-wide basis, nation-wide
    basis or particular to a group of users. Such additional functionality shall not
    compromise conformance to the core requirements of the service.\r\n"
