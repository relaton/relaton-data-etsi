abstract:
- content: "The EN303 520v1.1.1 is foreseen to be revised to accomplish a pragmatic
    \"commit and publish\" approach as agreed by EU Commission Ares(2018)2312282 -
    resolution meeting for the citation of EN 303 520 v1.1.1 on the OJEU, subject
    to ETSI's commitment to timely resubmit a new version which will amend a couple
    of items.\r\nThese two items were confirmed by an EC RE-D Desk correspondence
    enquiry throughout the TCAM and ADCO members positively ended by 30th May 2018.\r\nIt
    was also blessed that due to the need to timely resubmit a new version of EN303
    520, the scope of a NWI is limited to these two technical issues only, leaving
    to future versions any additional technical change as might be required."
