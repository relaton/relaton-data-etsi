abstract:
- content: "The present document contains: \r\n1) work on a gap analysis report on
    intent information model based on existing SDO work, including the policy management
    model as specified by ETSI ISG ENI in the system architecture deliverables, and,\r\n2)
    the report also provides a list of recommendations on general guidelines addressing
    the high-level policy model of a number of each SDOâ€™s intent policy model (i.e.:
    3GPP SA5, NFV, TM Forum, IRTF, and ZSM), and how these guidelines compare with
    those stated in the ETSI ENI system architecture.\r\n\r\n"
