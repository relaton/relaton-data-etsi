  content: "The scope of this work item is to identify and study communication mechanisms:\r\n\r\n(1)\tfor
    the coexistence and coordination of different cognitive radio networks and nodes,
    operating in unlicensed bands like the ISM band or as secondary users in TV White
    Spaces; \r\n\r\n(2)\tfor the management of Opportunistic Networks, operating in
    the same bands as mentioned above. The scope and definition of Opportunistic Networks
    will be elaborated within this WI; in particular, it is expected that Opportunistic
    Networks will include mechanisms for operator-governed ad-hoc coverage extensions
    or capacity extensions of infrastructure networks.  \r\nThe communication is expected
    to include procedures from terminal to terminal as well as between a terminal
    and infrastructure networks. These mechanisms could be radio access technology
    (RAT) specific or/and be RAT-independent.   In particular, the work item will
    carry out a study on the following topics:  \r\n\r\n(i) Methods for delivery of
    context and policy information in heterogeneous environments;\r\n\r\n(ii) Discovery
    and identification of neighbouring devices; \r\n\r\n(iii) Enable creation, maintenance
    and termination of opportunistic networks; \r\n\r\n(iv) Consider previous work
    on in-band-Cognitive Pilot Channel (CPC) and Cognitive Control Radio (CCR); \r\n\r\n(v)
    Implementation options for Control Channels for Cognitive Radio Systems.  \r\n\r\nThe
    work will be undertaken in accordance to the recently agreed standardization process
    as outlined in document RRS(10)0113. In parallel to the Normative Process, this
    WI will follow the Feasibility Study Process and provide implementation options
    which are recommended to be considered within the further work within the Normative
    Process.\r\n"
