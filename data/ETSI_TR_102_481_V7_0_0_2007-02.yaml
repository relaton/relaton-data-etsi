  content: "Approved in SCP#23\r\n\r\nWID SCP-050477\r\n\r\nScope of work to be undertaken:\r\nThe
    following aspects will be considered:\r\nSpecific use cases;\r\nExternal peripherals
    to be considered (memory cards, camera, biometric sensors, GPS receiver,);\r\nType
    of data exchange (retrieving data from peripheral, sending data to peripheral,
    );\r\nEvaluation on the opportunity of mechanisms to notify the UICC that new
    external peripherals have been plugged in;\r\nNegotiation procedure to identify
    available peripherals and exchange information about capabilities;\r\nAuthentication
    mechanisms based on external peripherals (such as fingerprints, face recognition,);\r\nProcedure
    to grant preservation of user confidentiality and exposure of user confidential
    and/or sensitive information without user awareness and acceptance\r\nDeliverables\r\nThis
    work item will deliver a TR in order to eventually give input for CR's to ETSI
    102.412 specification.\r\n"
