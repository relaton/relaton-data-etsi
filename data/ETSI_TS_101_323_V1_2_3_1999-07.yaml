  content: "This work item defines a set of protocols and associated profiles for
    security mechanisms that nay be used by Internet telephony equipment. Those security
    mechanisms may provide authorisation, confidentiality, access control, non-repudiation,
    and data integrity. The work item provides sufficient detail so that Internet
    telephony devices that conform to these specifications will be mutually interoperable.
    This work item defines security at a service level, and it is intended that network
    operators will be able to unambiguously define the security of Internet telephony
    services at least at the lowest level, including both, public key and secret key
    technologies. \r\n\r\n"
