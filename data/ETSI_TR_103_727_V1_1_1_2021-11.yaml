abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The present document describes  national parameters and implementations
    in the context of the Inter LEA Handover Interface (ETSI TS 103 462) and cross-border
    data exchange in criminal matters, e.g. through bilaterally agreed legal assistance
    (MLAT) or using the secure European Judicial Network. One aspect is the mapping
    of national data structures and single parameters into a related ETSI standard
    and, if necessary, also the mapping back into the national structure. \r\n\r\nIn
    addition, the present document gives an overview about the necessary parameters
    for the handover itself in the form of a library for Lawful Interception (LI)
    and Lawful Disclosure (LD). For the library no special values for the parameters
    are specified, but the (bilateral) tuning of these parameters is facilitated.
    For the deployment cases where no ETSI conformant implementation is available,
    the present document provides examples of mapping between national formats and
    the ETSI format as defined in the ETSI TS 102 232 family of specifications for
    LI.\r\n\r\nThe juridical aspects for using the provided mapping are out of scope
    of the present document. \r\n\r\nThe considerations provided in the present document
    do not modify, override, or otherwise introduce incompatible changes to ETSI or
    national standards, nor do they prescribe requirements on communication service
    providers."
