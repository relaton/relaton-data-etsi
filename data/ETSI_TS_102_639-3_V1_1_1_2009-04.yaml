abstract:
- content: "his ETSI Standard is part of a series that define the third generation
    of  interface specifications for high-speed data-over-cable systems in Europe.
    This document may be based on, but not limited to, ITU-T SG9 J.222 Recommendation.
    The scope of this work item will include definition of PHY (physical), Security
    services and MAC and Upper Layer Protocol Interfaces for a third generation transmission
    system for IP cable modems. This third generation provides for advanced features
    including the ability to bond multiple channels together and support for IP version
    6, while maintaining backwards compatibility with the first generation [ES 201
    488] and second generation [ES 202 488].\r\nThis particular part describes the
    downstream interface specifications for the third generation of high-speed Data-Over-Cable
    Systems."
