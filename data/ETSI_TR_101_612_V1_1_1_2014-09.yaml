abstract:
- content: This work item will provide a technical overview over the needed cross
    layer DCC algorithms to be implemented into the DCC management entity. The report
    will describe the algorithms in detail and will include performance evaluation
    results based on simulations. The report will include cross layer power control
    algorithms in support of the DCC functionality, a rate control algorithm and the
    needed parameter management functionalities. The report will be the bases for
    the specification of the cross layer DCC management entity in WI DTS/ITS-0020046
    and the validation of the entity in DTR/ITS-0020056.
