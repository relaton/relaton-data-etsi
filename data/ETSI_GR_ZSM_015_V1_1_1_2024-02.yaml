abstract:
- content: "This report will describe the Network Digital Twin concept,  investigate
    its applicability for automation of  zero-touch network and service management
    and introduce existing, emerging and future scenarios that can benefit from it.\r\nPrinciples
    and functionality needed  to support and utilize the Network Digital Twin for
    zero-touch network and service management will be introduced, considering also
    state of the art. The report will outline recommendations of additional capabilities
    needed in the ZSM framework to support Network Digital Twins.  The report will
    identify existing specifications and solutions (both ETSI and external ones) that
    can be leveraged to maximize synergies. Collaboration with other SDOs (e.g. in
    IRTF NMRG, ITU-T SG13) will be recommended when appropriate."
