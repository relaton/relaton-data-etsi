abstract:
- content: "The present document defines an electronic interface between two systems
    for the exchange of information relating to the establishment and management of
    Lawful Interception. Typically this interface would be used between: on one side,
    a Communications Service Provider; and, on the other side, a Law Enforcement Agency
    who is entitled to request Lawful Interception.\r\nThe present document is a specific
    and detailed example of one particular Warrantry interface.\r\nThe present document
    also supports Lawful Disclosure, which encompasses the various processes that
    deal with requests for data stored within the CSP domain, on behalf of a government
    authorised organisation.\r\nThis revision is to provide the following: Updated
    Format Descriptions for ETSI Target Identifiers; Closing JSON schemas; JSON schema
    for Dictionaries; Clarification of the use of the Transaction Identifier and removal
    of redundant clause; Extending contact details; Records Record Request; Additional
    Delivery Handover."
