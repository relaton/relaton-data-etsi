- language: en

  content: The intent of the work item is to address business continuity arising from
    the concern that quantum computing is likely to invalidate the problems that lie
    at the heart of both RSA and ECC asymmetric cryptography. The current assumptions
    that underpin the security strength of RSA and ECC are that the solution to the
    prime factoring, and the discrete logarithm problems are infeasible without prior
    knowledge. It has been widely suggested that the application of quantum computing
    to these problems removes the assertion of infeasibility.  Whilst it is not known
    when quantum computing will arrive or how long it will be until the factorisation
    and discrete logarithm problems are themselves solved the report will review the
    nature of the algorithms when subjected to QC attack and why they become vulnerable.
    In addition the report will highlight the characteristics required of algorithms
    in order to be invulnerable under QC attack.  The report will consider a number
    of sub topics to be covered in considering the transition to the post-quantum
    era and they are not all algorithmic but many of the necessary considerations
    apply to business continuity. For example how to re-assert CAs in a PKI? How to
    distribute new algorithms? How to distribute new keys?
