abstract:
- content: "Technical solutions for establishing the energy efficiency index of smartphones
    and slate tablets. Description of the apparatus to be used, necessary steps and
    conditions for the measurement and calculation of the EEI, and the information
    to be given in the test report. Instructions for tests for multiple displays and
    strategy for regular updates to the deliverables. \r\n\r\nRemarks: The current
    transitional test method for the Energy Efficiency Index (EEI) presents challenges
    for reproducibility and does not fully reflect real-world usage. This standard
    will establish a well-defined, reproducible methodology, creating a clear path
    for compliance and ensuring the EEI is a reliable and meaningful metric for consumers."
