  content: "This ETSI Technical Report (ETR) is a collection of terms, definitions\r\nand
    abbreviations related to the baseline documents defining Universal\r\nMobile Telecommunications
    System (UMTS) objectives and systems\r\nframework. This ETR provides a tool for
    further work on UMTS technical\r\ndocumentation and facilitates their understanding.\r\nThe
    terms, definitions and abbreviations as given in this ETR are\r\neither imported
    from existing documentation (ETSI, ITU or elsewhere)\r\nor newly created by UMTS
    experts whenever the need for precise\r\nvocabulary was identified.\r\nNew terms,
    definitions and abbreviations may emerge in new documents\r\nspecifying UMTS in
    greater detail. In this process, the consistency of\r\nUMTS terminology is maintained
    with updates of this ETR.\r\nAll efforts have been made to harmonize this vocabulary,
    i.e. to avoid\r\nconflicts with the usage of the same or similar terms in other
    not\r\nUMTS related applications.\r\n"
