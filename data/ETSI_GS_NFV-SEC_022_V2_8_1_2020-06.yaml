abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-SEC 022 conducts NFV Release 2 maintenance. It corrects
    errors, ambiguities, misalignments, and applies editorial modifications (i.e.
    Corrections of category F and D as described in ETSI TWPs Annex L). This edition
    does not add or modify features, nor does it extend the scope of the former Release
    2 edition summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-SEC 022 defines the access tokens and
    related metadata for RESTful protocols and data model for ETSI NFV management
    and orchestration (MANO) interfaces. It defines also the process for the token
    verification by the API Producer. For this aim, the document:\r\n- Analyses the
    security threat arising from the misuse of the access token and defines the security
    requirements associated to access token.\r\n- Analyses existing specifications
    related to access token for API access and their compliancy with the requirements
    defined.\r\n- Defines the token request and generation profile, the token format
    and associated metadata considering the result of existing access token specifications
    analysis.\r\n- Defines the token verification procedures for the API Producer.\r\n"
