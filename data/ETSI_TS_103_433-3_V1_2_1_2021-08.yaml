abstract:
- content: The goal of the present work item is to produce a revision that provides
    support for two additional video codecs, VVC and AV1, that have appeared on the
    market. These codecs come in addition to what the previous version of TS 103 433-3
    V1.1.1 standardized, i.e. a single layer enhancement for HDR systems using the
    HLG transfer function enabling high performance display adaptation.
