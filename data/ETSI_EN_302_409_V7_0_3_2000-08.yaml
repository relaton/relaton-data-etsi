abstract:
- content: "The present document defines the aspects of the internal organization
    of the FP-SIM which are related to the CTS initialization and CTS enrolment operation
    phase of CTS as well as the files contained in the SIM for dedicated CTS operation
    . This is to ensure interoperability between a FP-SIM and a CTS-FPE independently
    of the respective manufacturers and operators.\r\nThe present document defines:\r\n-the
    contents of the files required for the CTS application;\r\n-the application protocol.\r\nAll
    information regarding the interface between the Fixed Part Subscriber Identity
    Module (FP-SIM) and the Cordless Telephony System Fixed Part Equipment (CTS-FPE)
    mentioned below are fully compliant with the TS-GSM11.11 [12] unless otherwise
    stated in this present document. \r\n-the requirements for the physical characteristics
    of the FP-SIM, the electrical signals and the transmission protocols;\r\n-the
    model which shall be used as a basis for the design of the logical structure of
    the FP-SIM;\r\n-the security features;\r\n-the interface functions;\r\n-the commands.\r\n\r\nFor
    more details regarding CTS, refer to specifications GSM 02.56 [3]and GSM 03.56
    [6]. \r\nThe present document does not specify any aspects related to the administrative
    management phase. Any internal technical reallocation of either the FP-SIM or
    the CTS-FPE are only specified where these reflect over the interface. It does
    not specify any of the security algorithms which may be used.\r\n"
