abstract:
- content: This work item will define management interfaces to integrate QKD with
    disaggregated network control plane architectures, in particular with Software
    Defined Networks (SDN). It will define abstraction models and workflows between
    a SDN-enabled QKD node and the SDN Controller. This will include resource discovery,
    capabilities dissemination and system configuration operations.  Application layer
    interfaces and quantum-channel interfaces will be out of scope.
