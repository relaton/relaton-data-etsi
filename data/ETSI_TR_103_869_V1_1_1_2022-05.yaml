abstract:
- content: This Technical Report will analyze the security threats faced by Network
    Routers, which are carrier-grade routers deployed in IP metropolitan area networks
    (MANs) and IP backbone networks. This TR will also recommend measures for risk
    mitigation posed by these threats. This work item will focus on Network Router
    hardware, software, data, and interfaces to identify and analyze the security
    threats to which they are subject, and document mitigation to these threats throughout
    the Network Router lifecycle, from product development to product decommission.
    The Technical Report will use the same basic methodology approach as DTR/CYBER-0056.
