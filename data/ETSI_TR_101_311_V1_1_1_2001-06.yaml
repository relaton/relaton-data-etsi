  content: "This report collects requirements on the transport plane (comprising the
    transport abstraction layer and the services it derives from the underlying network
    abstraction layer and any associated physical networks) for the TIPHON service.
    This service  comprises of interworked voice and voice-band communication for
    the earlier releases of TIPHON and may grow to multi-media between the SCN and
    IP-based networks.\r\nRealizing these services express requirements on the transport
    abstraction layer that have not been design issues when IP was created. This document
    captures the TIPHON requirements that have been created in the several working
    groups as well as interaction between those requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
