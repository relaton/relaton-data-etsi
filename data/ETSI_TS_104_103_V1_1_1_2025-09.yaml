  content: "The work item will describe the problem arising from pervasive encrypted
    traffic in electronic/digital communications networks. The work item will identifiy
    the impact of encrypted traffic on a number of stakeholders and how the stakeholders'
    objectives work together. The characterization of traffic as either user generated
    content, user generated signalling, network signalling, and metadata, and the
    relative impact on stakeholders is considered. The work item will also consider
    the role of compliance obligations on the development and deployment of encrypted
    traffic and how it impacts different stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the work
    item is to consider the impact of pervasive encryption on stakeholders, and to
    assist future standards development activity in mitigating the negative impact
    on stakeholders whilst not adversely impacting the positive impacts of such a
    paradigm on stakeholders, including the regulatory and lawful dimensions. "
