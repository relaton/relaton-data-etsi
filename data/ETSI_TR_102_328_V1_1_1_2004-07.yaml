  content: To prepare a TR to give information about MESH-topology FWA-systems within
    frequency range 3-11 GHz. The work will include system description, verification
    of coexistence issues with other systems, performance evaluation, spectrum utilization
    and also comparison with other topologies as well as identifying aspects in present
    TM4 standards which may need to be modified.
