  content: The present document describes the motivations for the standardization
    of technology which enables Energy Efficient IP Video Surveillance Systems over
    new and legacy Coaxial Infrastructures. The technology enables the transmission
    of both IP data and power over a single coaxial cable, and is based as much as
    possible on existing standards. The standardization of this technology is needed
    for the deployment of sustainable Video Surveillance Systems using interoperable
    products from different manufacturers.
