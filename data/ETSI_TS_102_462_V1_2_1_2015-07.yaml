- content: This technical specification will define the QoS architecture of the BSM
    Protocol Manager (BPM) which resides above the SI-SAP and defines how IP protocols
    and packet markings are interpreted and transmitted through the BSM, which satellite
    independent (SI) protocols are used and how they in turn trigger the Satellite
    Dependent (SD) functions.
