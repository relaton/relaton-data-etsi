abstract:
- content: "A measurement campaign is needed to validate TR 103 580 interference simulation
    results and to confirm simulation parameters which would be used to define the
    proper mitigation area to protect Urban Rail communications in 5915-5925 MHz.
    The following steps have to be achieved:\r\n1.\tIdentify relevant test cases\r\n2.\tIdentify
    relevant areas to conduct the measurements\r\n3.\tDescribe test procedures for
    each case\r\n4.\tConduct the measurement campaign \r\n5.\tConclude on the results"
