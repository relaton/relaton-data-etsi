abstract:
- content: "This Telecommunication Standard (TS) describes the detailed mapping from
    input blocks of 160 speech samples in 13-bit uniform PCM format to encoded blocks
    of 95, 103, 118, 134, 148, 159, 204, and 244 bits and from encoded blocks of 95,
    103, 118, 134, 148, 159, 204, and 244 bits to output blocks of 160 reconstructed
    speech samples. The sampling rate is 8 000 samples/s leading to a bit rate for
    the encoded bit stream of 4.75, 5.15, 5.90, 6.70, 7.40, 7.95, 10.2 or 12.2 kbit/s.
    The coding scheme for the multi-rate coding modes is the so-called Algebraic Code
    Excited Linear Prediction Coder, hereafter referred to as ACELP. The multi-rate
    ACELP coder is referred to as MR-ACELP.\r\nIn the case of discrepancy between
    the requirements described in this TS and the fixed point computational description
    (ANSI-C code) of these requirements contained in [4], the description in [4] will
    prevail. The ANSI-C code is not described in this TS, see [4] for a description
    of the ANSI-C code.\r\nThe transcoding procedure specified in this TS is mandatory
    for systems using the AMR speech codec. \r\n"
