abstract:
- content: "This Global System for Mobile communications Technical Specification (\r\nGTS)
    gives the stage 2 description of Unstructured Supplementary Servi\r\nce Data (USSD).\r\nThe
    unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) mechanism allows th\r\ne Mobile
    Station (MS) user and a PLMN operator defined application to\r\ncommunicate in
    a way which is transparent to the MS and to intermediat\r\ne network entities.
    The mechanism allows development of PLMN specific\r\nsupplementary services.\r\nThis
    specification defines the requirements for handling USSD at the M\r\nS and network
    entities. It does not include specification of particula\r\nr applications, nor
    does it specify how a particular application is se\r\nlected. Where more than
    one application exists at a network entity, ro\r\nuting of messages to the correct
    application is carried out by the USS\r\nD handler. The MMI for USSD is specified
    in GSM 02.30 and GSM 02.90. T\r\nhe alphabet indicator and the data coding scheme
    are defined in GSM 03\r\n.38.\r\nUSSD may be initiated by the MS user, or by the
    network in the followi\r\nng ways:\r\n-\tNetwork initiated USSD\t(clause 1);\r\n-\tMobile
    initiated USSD\t(clause 2).\r\n "
