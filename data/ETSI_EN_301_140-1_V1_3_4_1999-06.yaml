abstract:
- content: "To produce a version of INAP for CS2 with as few options as possible\r\nsuitable
    for implementation in Europe. Close co-operation must be\r\nensured with SPS2
    with regard to CTM and UPT support. Other aspects\r\nwhich need to be addressed
    are those surrounding VPN such as CTN and\r\nGVNS. The Call Party Handling procedures
    must also be supported. The\r\nvalidated SDLl model must be part of th enormative
    text and shall\r\ndefine the behaviour of the various operations applicable for
    the\r\ndefined IN CS2 functional interface.\r\nThe specification should also address
    aspects of interaction between\r\nIN structured networks. As a result of this,
    new IN functionality may\r\nbe identified such as the interworking function; the
    impact this has\r\non the INAP and ISUP/DSS1 will need to be explored.\r\nThe
    CS2 definitions should be fully compatible with the existing CS1\r\nINAP.\r\n "
