abstract:
- content: This work item will cover the overall validation of the cross layer DCC
    functionality of the ETSI ITS architecture. It will consider the inputs from the
    cross layer DCC specification developed in DTS/ITS-0020046, the cross layer algorithm
    description in DTR/ITS-0020055  And the DCC specifications developed in the other
    relevant layers (DCC-Facility, DCC_Net, DCC_Access).This report is intended to
    support the test specification to be developed in a future WI.
