  content: "The purpose of the amendment to this ETS is to correct the\r\nerrors in
    the published document following the PE 82 and subsequent\r\nV99. Where the existing
    scope shall not be altered from \"This ETS\r\ndefines protocols for the operation
    of a Channel Aggregation Unit\r\neffecting synchronisation and aggregation of
    multiple ISDN channels\r\nat 64 kbit/s, these channels being with a differential
    delay in the\r\nrange of +/-1 second and with or without octet integrity structure.\r\nIt
    also addresses the case of interworking with a digital network\r\nrestricted to
    a rate of 56kbit/s. It is applicable to a wide range\r\nof user data transport
    up to 63 channels using ISO/IEC 13871, but\r\nspecial provision is made for audiovisual
    systems according to\r\nETS 300 144, up to 24 channels; the aggregation may be
    network-based\r\nor associated with Customer-Premises Equipment. The available\r\noperating
    modes (B1, B2, B3, H2) provide options with/without transmis\r\nsion-management
    overhead and user-dat\r\na rates at or less than the exact multiples of 64 kbit/s
    or\r\n56 kbit/s.The number of aggregated channels may be varied dynamically\r\nduring
    asession. Procedures are given for dealing with faults,\r\nincluding loss of channels
    and slip. Call control is outside the\r\nscope of this ETS.\"\r\n "
