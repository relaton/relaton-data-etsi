  content: "Further enhancements of the TETRA air interface standard in order to provide
    increased benefits and optimisation in terms of spectrum efficiency, network capacity,
    system performance, quality of service, size and cost of terminals, battery life,
    and other relevant parameters.\r\nAlso to include:\r\nExtension of the range of
    TETRA, to provide increased coverage range and low cost deployments for applications
    such as airborne public safety, maritime, rural telephony and 'linear utilities'
    (eg pipelines).\r\nOther requirements may also be identified during the course
    of the work, for example for the provision of location information.\r\nOne TR
    for a feasibility study plus a number of ES deliverables expected. Areas to be
    considered will include:\r\n-mobility management enhancements;\r\n-protocol stack;\r\n-C/I
    measurements;\r\n-downlink power control;\r\n-reporting and handover;\r\n-frequency
    hopping and loading;\r\n-cell structures;\r\n-speech delay, FEC, CRC;\r\n-speech
    delay framing;\r\n-long range applications.\r\n"
