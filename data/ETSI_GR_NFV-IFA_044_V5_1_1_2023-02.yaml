    benefit from further VNF deployment flexibility in terms of selecting VNFCs to
    be deployed and attributes of deployed VDUs and use cases related to the operational
    aspects of introducing such a flexibility b) analyse potential impacts in VNFDs
    and interfaces c) produce a set of recommendations for requirements to introduce
    the functionality. The deliverable will be an informative report.'
