  content: "Provide an overall technical framework description to assist understanding
    the role of individual elements in NGN standardisation, \r\nIdentify the relevant
    interfaces (interfaces between fixed/ mobile networks and services; between the
    \"private\" user domain / public domain) e.g.: architectural basic interfaces
    (IMS), Point of interconnection: Poi, NNI (net-net interconnection including vertical
    integration), SNI (service-net interconnection), ASI (application-network interconnection),
    and NTP, Residential Gateway (network control unit versus more modular approach),
    \r\nAnalyse the consequences on standardisation process from the EU ECN&S regulatory
    view point covering public interest issues (Quality of service issues to users,
    etc.) and increasing of competition,\r\nIdentify areas where standardisation is
    needed to achieve public interest objectives and to increase competition."
