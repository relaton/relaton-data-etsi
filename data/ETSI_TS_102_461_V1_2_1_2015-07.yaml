abstract:
- content: This technical specification will define how a multicast source may "connect"
    to the BSM network, including optional local sources. It will consider knowledge
    of where the source enters the BSM network, where it comes from and where in the
    network it is to be delivered. This may depend on the source address, or contributing
    network.
