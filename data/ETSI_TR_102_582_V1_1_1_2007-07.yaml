abstract:
- content: "To study the feasibility of including an additional low bit rate speech
    codec as part of TETRA, to enable interoperability without transcoding, between
    TETRA and other  networks supporting lower bit rate voice coding, Topics are expected
    to include: -speech coding; -FEC, CRC, interleaving; -protocol amendment. If the
    feasibility study is judged to be successful, then enhancement will be made to
    EN 300 395 PARTS 1 to 4.\r\n"
