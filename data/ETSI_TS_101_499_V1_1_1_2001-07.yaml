  content: "The DAB Slide Show Application describes the protocol required to convey
    one slide at a time from a service provider to 'slide show terminals': allowing,
    after complete and error-free reception, presentation on a display as triggered
    by the service provider.\r\nThe DAB Slide Show Application applies the DAB-MOT
    protocol and each 'slide', together with its 'presentation-trigger' , is taken
    as one object. It is segmented and its segments are transferred according to the
    rules of the MOT protocol.  A slide show may be transferred either in the PAD
    channel being part of an audio programme or independently in a packet channel
    of its own.\r\n"
