abstract:
- content: "Total Conversation, as defined in ITU-T F.703, is a combination of three
    media in a conversational call: video, real-time text and audio. Total conversation
    services and terminals are deployed in the Internet in a number of countries in
    Europe, and adopted by people with disabilities who, for example, need video for
    sign language or real-time text for a text based conversation or as complement
    to a voice conversation. The objective of this Work Item is to define precise
    conditions for using Total conversation for emergency services and make access
    of emergency services possible to people with disabilities. The Work Item will
    mainly address the PSAP organisations and potential impact on overall organisations
    of emergency services.  For example it should address functional requirements
    regarding the interface to the PSAP, the connection to external supporting services,
    the transferring and sharing of the call between call handling organisations,
    the call logging and call recording, call back aspects and specific call routing
    and location information provision aspects for these calls.\r\nDue consideration
    of present ongoing standardisation work (e.g. 3GPP) and appropriate liaisons with
    relevant groups (e.g. EGEA) will be organised as required during the progress
    of this Work Item."
