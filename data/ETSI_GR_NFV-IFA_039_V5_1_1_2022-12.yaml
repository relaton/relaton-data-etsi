  content: This work item aims at studying the feasibility of the application of a
    Service-Based Architecture (SBA) design style to the NFV architectural framework.
    This includes  but is not limited to  making interfaces independent from reference
    points and identifying potential NFV services. The deliverable will provide recommendations
    on the evolution of the ISG specifications structure and on normative work to
    be carried out to apply SBA design patterns to the NFV architectural framework.
