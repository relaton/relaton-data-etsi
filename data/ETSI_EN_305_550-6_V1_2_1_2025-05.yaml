abstract:
- content: "This EN will cover SRD radiodetermination equipment using Ultra Wide Band
    technlogy (UWB) to be used in the frequency ranges 116 to 148,5 GHz; 167 to 182
    GHz and 231,5 to 250 GHz for Level Probing Radar (LPR) and Tank Level Probing
    Radar (TLPR). The LPR and TLPR equipment is intended for industrial and professional
    use only.\r\nThis includes a detailed description of the wanted technical performance
    requirements, RX- and TX-requirements and limits based on clear test procedures.\r\nEquipment
    covered by the present document operates in accordance with the results of ECC
    Report 334 (previously SE24 WI71), ECC Decision(22)03 and the upcoming EC framework
    for UWB/SRDs for the range 116 to 260GHz.\r\n"
