abstract:
- content: "This WI presents a cross---cutting framework (covering compute, hypervisor
    and infrastructure network domains, also data, control, and management planes)
    which describes how NFV interfaces and abstractions are to be derived and specified.\r\n\r\nThe
    WI describes the concepts associated with interfaces and abstractions. It covers
    the specification process / methodology in general. Provision is made for exposing
    a subset of an interface and for translating between interfaces to facilitate
    interworking.\r\n\r\nNote that this WI does not specify all the interfaces and
    abstractions as these are covered by the domain specific documents. Examples of
    interfaces and abstractions are nevertheless supplied to illustrate the methodology.
    As the framework may also be of interest to the SA and MANO WGs, they need to
    be consulted and kept abreast. This document does not provide or standardize detailed
    specifications. Where appropriate it refers to existing or potential future specifications
    developed by other bodies.  "
