  content: "The purpose of the present document is to provide further information
    on prominent control loop architectures that can be used in modular system design.
    This will be applied to the ENI reference system architecture (and any other applicable
    ETSI reports and standards). The present document will emphasize control loops
    that are adaptive and cognitive. In release 2, the present document will more
    detail on clause 4.4.4. It will also make any other updates that are required.\r\n\r\n"
