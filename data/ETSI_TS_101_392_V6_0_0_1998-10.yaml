  content: "The scope of this Technical Specification is to provide a specification
    for interworking between the ISDN Application Service Element (ASE) protocol for
    supplementary services and the Mobile Application Part (MAP) protocol on MAP D-interface
    protocol for handling of supplementary services within the digital cellular telecommunications
    system (Phase2+). This version of the specification includes the interworking
    for the Call Completion to Busy Subscriber (CCBS) service between the ISDN CCBS-ASE
    and MAP. \r\nThe MAP protocol for CCBS service is specified in GSM 09.02. The
    ISDN CCBS-ASE protocol is specified in ETS 300 356-18. The ISDN CCBS-ASE protocol
    is also commonly referred to as the SSAP protocol in GSM 03.93. This specification
    clarifies the interworking within the HLR between these protocols for the Call
    Completion to Busy Subscriber (CCBS) service.\r\nSection 4 describes the mapping
    between MAP application layer messages and SSAP application layer messages \r\nSection
    5 describes the mapping between MAP message parameters and SSAP message parameters.\r\nSection
    6 describes the SCCP layer addressing for messages on the SSAP interface. It also
    describes the mapping of the messages at the TC transaction sublayer between the
    MAP D and SSAP interfaces.\r\n"
