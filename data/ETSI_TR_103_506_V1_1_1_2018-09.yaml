  content: "Determine an initial semantic model for Smart Cities based on a limited
    set of use cases and from available existing data model.\r\nThis work is expected
    to be developed in close collaboration with AIOTI, the H2020 Large Scale Pilots
    and with ETSI activities in the Smart Cities, primarly ISG CIM. Use cases  and
    related semantic model are expected to be aligned with corresponding work in CIM.\r\nFuther
    extensions are envisaged in future to cover entirely the Smart Cities domain"
