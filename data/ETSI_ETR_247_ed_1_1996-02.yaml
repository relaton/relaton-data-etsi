  content: "ITU-T Recommendation G.955 [1] contains minimum requirements for the\r\nperformance
    between reference points S and R of the optical path, in\r\nterms of attenuation
    and dispersion, for a digital line system on\r\nsingle-mode optical fibre. When
    combined with ITU-T Recommendation\r\nG.652 [2] on the fibre characteristics,
    these figures can be used in\r\na worst-case design for the maximum repeater section
    length. This\r\napproach employs worst-case values for all transmission parameters\r\nresulting
    in a repeater section design which guarantees attenuation\r\nand dispersion penalties
    between the S and R reference points which\r\nare lower the specified limits in
    100 % of all cases.\r\nStudies carried out in several countries, show that a worst-case\r\ndesign
    approach can lead to significant cost penalties for long-haul\r\nsystems. Recently
    statistical and semi-statistical approaches have\r\nbeen considered in designing
    the maximum repeater section length,\r\ntaking account of the expected statistical
    variations in the\r\ntransmission parameters of equipment and cable (e.g. cable\r\nattenuation,
    splice attenuation, transmitted power, etc.). These\r\napproaches are based on
    designing the maximum repeater section length\r\nfor a high probability (e.g.
    99 %) of each repeater section having an\r\nadequate system margin over the lifetime
    of the system. Statistical\r\nand semi-statistical approaches achieve significant
    cost-saving\r\nthrough reductions in the number of the repeaters for a long-haul\r\nsystem,
    but admit a pre determined probability of insufficient\r\noptical path allowances
    between reference points S and R. The cost\r\nsavings are substantial for remote
    power feeding systems where local\r\nelectrical power plant does not exist.\r\nThis
    ETR contains definitions of the different design approaches,\r\nstatistical dati
    forms and numerical examples for statistical design\r\nfor fibre optics systems.
    The use of this ETR is at the discretion of\r\nthe reader.\r\n"
