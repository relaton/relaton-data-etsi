  content: "Covers the core DVB requirements to enable interactive services suppor\r\nting
    broadcasting to the home with narrowband return channels. The sys\r\ntem defined
    in this ETS provides a generic solution for a variety of f\r\nuture interactive
    services, through the adoption of DSM-CC User-to-Use\r\nr, Download and Object
    Carousel protocols, as specified in MPEG2. The\r\ninteractive services are provided
    on systems consisting of a high bitr\r\nate downstream channel (up to the maximum
    bitrate of the Broadcast cha\r\nnnel) from the Service Providers to Service consumers
    and low bitrate\r\ninteraction channels (up to 150 kbit/s). The Broadcast Service
    Provide\r\nr and the Interactive Service Provider need not operate from the same\r\nlocation.
    The services are primarily digital video broadcast enhanced\r\nwith interactivity.
    At the simplest level the Interactive channel allo\r\nws the consumer to react
    by voting, to order articles displayed in the\r\nbroadcast programme, to select
    certain programme bouquets or to choos\r\ne movies in near-video-on-demand systems.
    It is also possible to deliv\r\ner text, graphics, audio and still pictures (including
    e-mail) on-dema\r\nnd , although this may require an interactive channel with
    higher bitr\r\nates.\r\nThere are many possible network configurations covering
    the currently\r\nspecified DVB broadcast options including satellite, terrestrial,
    cabl\r\ne, SMATV and MMDS in conjunction with PSTN, ISDN, cable and other Inte\r\nractive
    channel options. The network dependent protocols are specified\r\nin ETS 300 800/801
    & ETS 300 803.\r\nThe implications for interactive services via these types of
    networks\r\nare described in a separate guidelines document DTR/JTC-00DVB-44 \"Guid\r\nelines
    for the use of the DVB network-independent protocols for intera\r\nctive services\"
    which will also summtrise the functionality of the pro\r\ntocols identified in
    this ETS.\r\n  "
