  content: "The present document aims at explaining how the methodology described
    in EG 202 843 can be implemented using QoS assessments from various sources to
    compare the QoS of services provided by different Service Providers (SP). Some
    of these results, used as examples in EG 202 934, are more detailed in the present
    document. \r\n\r\nThe data used for this report has been collected from actual
    users according to best practices in this area. Nevertheless, this document should
    not be taken as an actual comparison of SP but rather as a tutorial about how
    such comparisons should be done, provided fully comparable data is available."
