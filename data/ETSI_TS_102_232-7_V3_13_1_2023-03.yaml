abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies an approach for the handover of the lawfully-intercepted
    information that is defined in the two standards: 3GPP TS 33.108 [3] and ANSI/J-STD-025-B
    [4]. The present document uses the handover techniques defined in ETSI TS 102
    232-1 [2]. In this way, the present document allows additional services to be
    delivered through a common interface.\r\nThis revision is to mediate payload direction
    from 3GPP TS 33.128."
