  content: "Carry out a requirement study on the standardization requirements for
    3D Gaming Graphics Delivery. The advantage will be that an ETSI MCD view on the
    topic is created. It also positions the ETSI MCD community for actual standardization.\r\nThe
    TR includes Use cases, requirements, overview of potential solutions and a gap
    analysis.\r\nOptions for the actual delivery include the specification of a transport
    protocol for streaming OpenGL-ES 2.0 primitives over a TCP connection or streaming
    of specialized 3D models.\r\nThe TR's conclusions should assist in the definition
    of a new Work Items provided this is necessary and ETSI MCD is the right body.
    (A decision on a TS is then taken only if the gap analysis is positive)."
