    (VOD) and multimedia interactive services over an ATM switched\r\nnetwork.\r\nSignalling
    scenarios will be developed showing the applicability of\r\nthe existing signalling
    capabilities. This work will be mainly based\r\non network reference configurations
    as identified by STC NA5; input\r\nfrom other bodies will also taken into consideration.\r\nThe
