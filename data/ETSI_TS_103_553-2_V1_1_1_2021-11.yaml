  content: "This Technical Report introduces evolution of Energy Storage applicable
    for use with stationary ICT/Telecom equipment and global results of investigations
    in laboratories or from field tests in Telecom/ICT network or customer premises
    e.g. for resilience in smart sustainable city. Mobile and portable batteries are
    out of the scope. \r\n\r\nThe scope of this document includes: - identification
    of available new battery technology or roadmap - Characteristics (electrical ,
    mechanical, thermal, ) - Test lab results and/or field experiment results - Recommendations
    of adapted use of each technology - Recommendation for appropriate minimum benchmark
    tests and deeper characterization  \r\n\r\nThese WIs are also present in ITU-T
    SG5/WP3 for a joint activity; ITU-T WI (L.ENST 1,2,3)"
