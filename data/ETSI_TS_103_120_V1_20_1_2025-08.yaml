abstract:
- content: "The present document defines an electronic interface between two systems
    for the exchange of information relating to the establishment and management of
    Lawful Interception. Typically this interface would be used between: on one side,
    a Communications Service Provider; and, on the other side, a Law Enforcement Agency
    who is entitled to request Lawful Interception.\r\nThe present document is a specific
    and detailed example of one particular Warrantry interface.\r\nThe present document
    also supports Lawful Disclosure, which encompasses the various processes that
    deal with requests for data stored within the CSP domain, on behalf of a government
    authorised organisation.\r\nThis revision is to provide the following: Update
    of obsolete IETF RFC references; Manual information for LDTaskObject; Deadline
    fields for LDTaskObject; Add discovery of CSP capabilities for e-Evidence regulation;
    Add LD Workflow Endpoints supported by CSP; Changes to support e-Evidence; New
    workflow profile for recurring tasks; Clarification of LDTaskFlag; Alignment of
    References in Table C.1 ETSI Target Identifier; Clarification on JSON names in
    relation to XML namespaces; Correction to delivery URL object description text."
