abstract:
- content: "Quantum cryptography is a brand new domain for most of the people who
    will use this technology in the close future. Coming from fundamental researchs,
    the QKD concepts carry a lot of confusions, bringing ambigous thoughts and misunderstandings
    and, at the end, making it quite difficult to explain and convince people not
    being familiar with them. Finally this fact has a strong negative impact on the
    general understanding of the QKD topic at this stage.\r\n The scope of this new
    Working Item proposal is to properly define all the vocabulary describing the
    concepts, the metrics, the labels and all the related items used on a daily basis
    by everybody working in the QKD domain. It has to bring  also an official clarification
    \ to some definitions/concepts conveniently borrowed and adapted from the cryptographic
    world. \r\nThis work will give the capacity to the QKD ISG, and to the QKD related
    industry,  to make a clear statement on how the QKD technology can be positionned
    and/or evaluated in the current actual operationnal world.  This away a future
    user/customer of this technology could use it as a strong official reference.\r\n"
