abstract:
- content: This document includes the definition of the Generic Stream Encapsulation
    (GSE) protocol, which allows for efficient encapsulation of IP and other network
    layer packets over a “generic” physical layer. Such a “generic” physical layer
    is intended as a transport mode that carries a sequence of data bits or data packets,
    possibly organized in frames, but with no specific timing constraints.
