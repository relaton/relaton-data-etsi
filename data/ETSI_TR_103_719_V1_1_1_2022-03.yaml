abstract:
- content: A survey and explainer for Identity Based Encryption â€“ technologies, use-cases,
    properties.The purpose of this report is to demystify IBE sufficiently that engineers
    can go and develop for it and adopt it for both encryption, and in digital signature
    applications. The report will describe the key management issues, the cryptography
    that underpins IBE, the threats and mitigations surrounding IBE, and also look
    at the wider worlds of conventional RSA and ECC based asymmetric crypto as well
    as ABE as a comparison. The report will in addition identify requirements for
    future IBE standardisation in ETSI CYBER.
