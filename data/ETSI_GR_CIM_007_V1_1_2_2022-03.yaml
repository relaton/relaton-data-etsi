  content: 'The purpose of this Work Item is to provide a state of the art assessment
    of security and privacy issues associated with ISG CIM specifications, in particular
    related to the API, Data Publishing Platforms and Data Model Work Items. Recommendations
    shall be accompanied by pro/con information with the intent to reference as much
    as possible existing widely supported concepts. There are several issues that
    need to be addressed, including but not limited to provenance of data, assuring
    privacy and security between stakeholders, assuring trust, understanding how to
    ensure the aggregation of data does not increase the attack space or compromise
    privacy. The work item will investigate items such as but not limited to; what
    should be connected via the information model and are there any particular lifecycle
    constraints that may be placed on data? The scope of this work is strictly limited
    to the CIM scope of work, e.g. device security is excluded. Where appropriate,
    it references existing work, specifications and standards. Safety and reliability
    issues for systems relying on CIM-based APIs and architectures are out of scope
    but may be addressed at a later date. '
