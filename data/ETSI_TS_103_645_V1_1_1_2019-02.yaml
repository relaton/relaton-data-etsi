  content: This Work Item is to initiate the development of an ETSI standard for consumer
    IoT security. The objective of the new ETSI standard is to contribute to improving
    consumers privacy, digital security and safety. The primary audience are those
    developing, producing and selling consumer IoT products. The ETSI standard is
    to contain around a dozen high-level outcome-focused requirements, which bring
    together what is widely considered good practice in IoT security. The ETSI standard
    will balance the goal of achieving good security outcomes with the need of it
    being implementable by even small businesses. The initial draft of the ETSI standard
    will be based on the Code of Practice for Security in Consumer IoT Products and
    Associated Services published in draft by DCMS in March 2018 as part of the Secure
    by Design report.
