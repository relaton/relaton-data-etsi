    challenges of virtual worlds:  Virtual economy and society, Virtual experiences,
    Human interfaces and AR/VR devices, Reality capture, Artificial Intelligence,
    Data management , Infrastructure. Information will be compiled about standardization
    activities that impact development of virtual world technologies, including core
