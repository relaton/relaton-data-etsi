abstract:
- content: "This Technical Basis for Regulation (TBR) specifies the technical\r\nrequirements
    to be met by terminal equipment capable of connection to\r\na public telecommunications
    network. These requirements apply to\r\nterminals for phase 1 of the public land
    mobile radio service\r\nutilising constant envelope modulation, operating in the
    900 MHz band\r\nwith a channel separation of 200 kHz, and carrying 8 full rate
    traffic\r\nchannels per carrier according to the Time Division Multiple Access\r\n(TDMA)
    principle.\r\nThis TBR covers the requirements for Global System for Mobile\r\ncommunications
    (GSM) access to the network.\r\nFor each conformance requirement, one or more
    test purposes are given.\r\nFor each test purpose, a single reference is given
    to the test method\r\nin GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2]. The requirements apply
    at the air\r\ninterface and the SIM-ME interface for the access requirements,
    which\r\nmay be stimulated to perform the tests by additional equipment if\r\nnecessary.\r\nThe
    measurement uncertainty is handled, as described in GSM 11.10\r\n(I-ETS 300 020-1)
    [2].\r\nThis TBR covers the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive\r\n91/263/EEC
    [1] Articles 4d, 4e, 4f. Non access related aspects of\r\nspeech telephony, where
    Article 4g has been applied, are covered by\r\nTBR 9 [7].\r\nThe Terminal Directive
    91/263/EEC [1] Articles 4a and 4b are covered\r\nby other directives, and, therefore,
    not by this TBR.\r\nIn this TBR, there are no EMC technical requirements in terms
    of the\r\nTerminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1], Article 4c.\r\nNOTE: Technical Requirements
    for EMC performance and testing of the\r\nequipment are covered by the relevant
    standards applicable to the EMC\r\nDirective 89/336/EEC, Annex A.\r\nTerminal
    equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other\r\nCommon Technical
    Regulations (CTR)ydepending on the equipments\r\nfunctionality.\r\nGSM 11.10 (I-ETS
    300 020-1) [2] constitutes the full conformance test\r\nsuite for GSM. The verification
    of the conformance requirements in\r\nthis TBR are based on the tests described
    in this reference. The set\r\nof requirements in GSM 11.10 (I-ETS 300 020-1) [2]
    and the set of\r\nrequirements in this TBR need not be identical.\r\n "
