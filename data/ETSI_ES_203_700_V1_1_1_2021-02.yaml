abstract:
- content: "This standard will define power feeding solutions for 5G equipment and
    network,  and their environmental impact. It will include requirements of different
    solutions and equipment on power feeding structures, components, backup solutions,
    environmental condition. Safety and EMC requirements will refer to relevant standards.\r\nThe
    future development of 5G networks justify this standard. It is plausible that
    a new scenario in which the density of radio cells will increase considerably,
    thereby creating the need to define new solutions for powering being environmentally
    friendly, sustainable, smart and with remote management that can include energy
    saving coordinated at network level.\r\nThe - 48 Vdc, up to 400 Vdc solutions
    defined in ETSI EN 300 132-2, ITU-T L.1200 will be considered as the standards
    in force for power facilities. Solution based on\r\nremote powering will refer
    to ETSI EN 302 099."
