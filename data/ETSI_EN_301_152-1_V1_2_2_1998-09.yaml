abstract:
- content: "To produce a version of INAP for CS1 Extension in order to cover the\r\nprotocol
    procedures for the Camel Phase 1 requirements suitable for\r\nimplementation in
    Europe. The work is based on operations and\r\nextensions received from SMG 3.
    Close co-operation must be ensured\r\nwith SMG3 with regard to Camel Phase 1 requirements.\r\nThe
    specification should also address aspects of interaction between\r\nIN structured
    networks. The Camel Phase 1 definitions should be fully\r\ncompatible with the
    existing CS1 INAP."
