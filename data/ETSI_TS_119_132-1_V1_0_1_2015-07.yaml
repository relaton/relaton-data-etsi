abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies XAdES digital signatures. XAdES signatures
    build on XML digital signatures, by incorporation of signed and unsigned qualifying
    properties, which fulfil certain common requirements (such as the long term validity
    of digital signatures, for instance) in a number of use cases.\r\nThe present
    document specifies XML Schema definitions for the aforementioned qualifying properties
    as well as mechanisms for incorporating them into XAdES signatures.\r\nThe present
    document specifies formats for XAdES baseline signatures, which provide the basic
    features necessary for a wide range of business and governmental use cases for
    electronic procedures and communications to be applicable to a wide range of communities
    when there is a clear need for interoperability of digital signatures used in
    electronic documents.\r\nThe present document defines four levels of XAdES baseline
    signatures addressing incremental requirements to maintain the validity of the
    signatures over the long term, in a way that a certain level always addresses
    all the requirements addressed at levels that are below it. Each level requires
    the presence of certain XAdES qualifying properties, suitably profiled for reducing
    the optionality as much as possible.\r\n"
