  content: The Call Forwarding on Not Reachable (CFNRc) supplementary service enables
    a served user to have the network redirect to another user calls which are addressed
    to the served user's ISDN number for the phase 1 of CTM. The CFNRc supplementary
    service operate on all calls. The served user's ability to originate calls is
    in principle unaffected by the CFNRc supplementary service.
