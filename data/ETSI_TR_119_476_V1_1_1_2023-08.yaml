abstract:
- content: The technical report analyses existing schemes for selective disclosure
    and zero knowledge proofs and their potential application for privacy of electronic
    attestation attributes in line with the expected requirement of the upcoming regulation
    amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (commonly called eIDAS2).  The aim of the
    technical report is to input to ETSI standardization relating to (Qualified) Electronic
    Attribute Attestations ((Q)EAA), in particular, (Q)EAA profiles and trust service
    provider policy requirements.
