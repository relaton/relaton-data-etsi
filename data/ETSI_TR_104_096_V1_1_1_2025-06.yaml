  content: The new work item will cover SRDs to be used for vehicles in the frequency
    ranges 300-400 GHz and 600-700 GHz. The target application is the imaging, detection
    and ranging of objects and the environment in front of and around a vehicle during
    highway and urban driving scenarios. Using SRDs at frequencies above 300 GHz will
    allow terahertz sensing with high resolution at ranges which are typical for a
    vehicle. The work will include a detailed description of technical characteristics,
    performance requirements and test procedures.
