abstract:
- content: "TSS & TP for Network Integration testing based on ITU-T Q.1912.5\r\nDue
    to practical reasons (resulting deliverable too big), 06012-1 was split into 06012-1
    for SIP-ISDN part and 06012-3 for the SIP- SIP Part (and not 06012-2, which is
    already used by another document).\r\n"
