  content: "The present document will describe a high level architecture for supporting
    lawful interception in network operator and communication service providers' domain
    for IP networks. \r\nThe document will contain:\r\nA generic reference model in
    the network operator and communication service provider domain.\r\nA High level
    description of Internal Network Functions and Interfaces.\r\nApplication of the
    reference model to voice and multimedia over IP services and data layer 3 and
    layer 2 services.\r\n\r\nThe present  document is designed to be compatible with
    any specified LI HO interfaces, like TS 102 232.     \r\nIt will not intend to
    replace any existing document which specifies network operator and communication
    service provider's architecture and internal network interfaces. The present document
    will not override or supersede any specifications or requirements for the lawful
    interception within GSM/UMTS PS domain, which is defined in TS 133.106 and TS
    133 107."
