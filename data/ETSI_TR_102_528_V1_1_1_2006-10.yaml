abstract:
- content: "The present document will describe a high level architecture for supporting
    lawful interception in network operator and communication service providers' domain
    for IP networks. \r\nThe document will contain:\r\n•A generic reference model
    in the network operator and communication service provider domain.\r\n•A High
    level description of Internal Network Functions and Interfaces.\r\n•Application
    of the reference model to voice and multimedia over IP services and data layer
    3 and layer 2 services.\r\n\r\nThe present  document is designed to be compatible
    with any specified LI HO interfaces, like TS 102 232.     \r\nIt will not intend
    to replace any existing document which specifies network operator and communication
    service provider's architecture and internal network interfaces. The present document
    will not override or supersede any specifications or requirements for the lawful
    interception within GSM/UMTS PS domain, which is defined in TS 133.106 and TS
    133 107."
