abstract:
- content: "REASON 1:\r\nGSM 07.05 defines the length of the SC address in table 5.6
    and 5.8 as\r\nbeing 1-13 octets long. This is not correct since the SC address\r\nlength
    is coded as the RP-Destination address specified in GSM 04.11.\r\nThese addresses
    can only be up to 12 octets long.\r\n CONSEQUENCES OF NON-ACCEPTANCE 1:\r\nImplementors
    may use too long addresses.\r\n REASON 2:\r\nAt the end of chapter 3.3 it is stated
    that it is possible for the TE\r\nto request the MT to both store and send the
    SMS message. It is\r\nunclear what happens to the stored message if the transmission
    fails\r\nafter the storing has suceeded.\r\n CONSEQUENCES OF NON-ACCEPTANCE 2:\r\nThe
    TE does not know the message reference of this SMS message and\r\nthus has no
    means of pointing to it.\r\n REASON 3:\r\nSection 3.1.2.2 defines GET NEXT MESSAGE
    command. right after GET\r\nFIRST MESSAGE command. GET NEXT MESSAGE command may
    give a wrong\r\nresponse in a situation where a session is started with a GET
    MESSAGE\r\ncommand.\r\n"
