abstract:
- content: "The work is referred to as Coded Multisource Media Format (CMMF).\r\nThe
    objective of this work is to develop a single specification that:\r\n-includes
    a reference architecture for generation and distribution of content, including
    real-time media content, that is coded in order to support delivery from multiple
    sources to a single receiver;\r\n-includes a definition of the necessary configuration
    information in order for the receiver to access the multiple sources and re-generate
    the original source content;\r\n-supports smart coding to enable efficient and
    reliable reception of content from multiple sources and/or network pathways and
    includes a coded source format including syntax and semantics that can be used
    by the receiver to collect data from multiple sources and reconstruct the original
    content;\r\n-includes an instantation of a framework supporting different already
    deployed coding schemes, including a new scheme referred to as xCD1, RaptorQ as
    defined in RFC6330 and Reed-Solomon in RFC 5510; and\r\n-includes deployment examples
    and guidelines for the usage of the format in different scenarios, for example
    in video-on-demand streaming with DASH or large file distribution."
