abstract:
- content: To provide countermeasure to assure that users of the NGN have protection
    from abuse of identity. This to cover Identity protection, authentication and
    integrity countermeasures and to define credential management. The document will
    extend from TR 187 010 and will identify the functional objectives from ISO 15408-2
    (particularly those in class Privacy and related to subject-user binding). The
    intended result will provide protection of identity and identifiers in the NGN
    from traffic analysis and allow compliance with the privacy legislation in the
    regions where the NGN is to be deployed. It is accepted that many of the countermeasures
    will be in the form of policies or procedures and such countermeasures will be
    marked as informative, whilst the technical countermeasures will be normative.
    The final document should follow the recommendations of EG 282 387 to allow its
    use as a Protection Profile.
