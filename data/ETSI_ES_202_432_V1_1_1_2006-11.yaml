abstract:
- content: 'Proposal to develop a family of symbols to denote the availability of
    a variety of access services, specifically: subtitling, audio description and
    signing of video content; voice command and voice output of a range of ICT devices.
    The symbols would be used to indicate the provision of such services in order
    to alert users, or their carers, to the presence of such in a language-independent,
    consistent and convenient manner.'
