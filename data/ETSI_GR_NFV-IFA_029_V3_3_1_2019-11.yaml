abstract:
- content: "The report will study the potential enhancements of the NFV architecture
    for providing \"PaaS\"-type capabilities and supporting VNFs which follow \"cloud-native\"
    design principles, in particular the utilization of container technologies.\r\nIt
    will describe the related use cases and provide recommendations on the enhancements
    of the NFV architecture for flexible choices for the designers of VNFs. Such platform
    features can include, but are not limited to, common platform services, dependency
    management, and accessing other VNFs.\r\nManagement and orchestration of VNFs
    deployed in containers will be analyzed and resulting recommendations on the enhancements
    of the NFV architecture will be provided, including impacts on the NFV templates,
    considering dependencies on the hosting resources.\r\nAn assumption is that some
    VNFs may be decomposed into small components (e.g., following a micro-services
    approach) and/or able to rely on common platfrom services. The study will take
    into account other initiatives in this space.\r\n\r\nIt is not the intention of
    this WI to define \"cloud-native\", nor to recommend how VNFs shall be decomposed
    and implemented.\r\nThe report will include recommendations for requirements and
    if necessary enhancements on architecture and reference points."
