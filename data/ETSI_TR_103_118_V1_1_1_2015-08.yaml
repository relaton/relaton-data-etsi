abstract:
- content: 'Review of security methods provided by deployed standards used in the
    Smart Energy industry (e.g. IEC 62351, IEC 62443...) or mandated by regulation
    (e.g. Requirements from the German BSI for Smart Meter Gateways and Secure Element)
    as well as gaps identified by the Smart Grid Information Security group for the
    M/490 mandate, in order to identify areas where ETSI in general and ETSI TC M2M
    in particular may bring additional value, e.g. by extending or harmonizing security
    solutions where possible. This could result in recommendations for areas of work
    shared with other ETSI groups (for potential actions falling outside the scope
    of TC M2M), new work item(s) proposals, or CRs within the scope of ETSI TC M2M,
    as applicable. '
