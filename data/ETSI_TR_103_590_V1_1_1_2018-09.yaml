abstract:
- content: "This technical report aims a definition of technical needed updates to
    the DECT standard to enable narrowband (NB), wideband (WB) and super wideband
    (SWB) audio call in existing DECT slot formats. All needed change requests should
    be listed and defined for the different DECT layers to enable high quality audio
    communication between DECT FP and PP. Also the use case in DECT repeaters should
    be defined.\r\n\r\nIn the Technical Report should also be studied and defined
    the need of CRC for the B-field and if FEC is needed or could improve the audio
    quality in some use cases for NB, WB and SWB."
