abstract:
- content: "Specify an initial extension to SAREF to include the semantic model for
    Smart Cities\r\nThis initial extension will be based on a limited set of use cases
    and available existing data model identified in the corresponding requirement
    TR.\r\nThis work is expected to be developed in close collaboration with AIOTI,
    the H2020 Large Scale Pilots and with ETSI activities in the Smart Cities, primarily
    ISG CIM. Use cases and related semantic model are expected to be aligned with
    corresponding work in CIM.\r\nFurther extensions are envisaged in future to cover
    entirely the Smart Cities domain. "
