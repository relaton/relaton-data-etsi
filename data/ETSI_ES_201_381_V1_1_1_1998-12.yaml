abstract:
- content: "This standard specifies the form, dimension, location of raised tactile
    identifiers in the form of small, raised dots on telecommunications keyboards
    and  keypads. Raised tactile identifiers help blind and visually impaired people
    identify the various keys of telephone keyboards and keypads. The identifiers
    should comply with existing standards for tactile identifiers in order to harmonize
    telecommunications terminals with other equipment.\r\n"
