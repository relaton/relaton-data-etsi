  content: "Baseline System for modulation and channel coding for satellite\r\ndigital
    multi-programme TV/HDTV services to be used for satellite\r\ndigital TV for primary
    and secondary distribution in FSS and BSS bands\r\nThe Baseline System is intended
    to provide Direct-to-Home (DTH)\r\nservices for consumer Integrated Receiver Decoders
    (IRDs) as well as\r\ncollective antenna systems (SMATV) and cable television head-end\r\nstations
    \ with a likelihood of remodulation.\r\nThe Baseline System uses QPSK modulation
    and concatenated error\r\nprotection strategy based on a convolutional code and
    a shortened\r\nReed-Solomon code.\r\nThe Baseline System is suitable for use on
    different satellite\r\ntransponder bandwidths.\r\nCompatibility with MPEG-2 coded
    TV services, with a transmission\r\nstructure synchronous with the packet multiplex,
    is provided.\r\nThe multiplex flexibility allows the use of transmission capacity
    for\r\na variety of TV service configurations, including sound and data\r\nservices.
    All service components are time multiplexed (TDM) on a\r\nsingle digital carrier.\r\n"
