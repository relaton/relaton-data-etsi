abstract:
- content: "The HGI service providers, starting from their own business\r\nrequirements
    and use cases, and with the consultation of\r\nHGI vendor companies, have set
    out the key requirements\r\nfor wireless home area networks (WHANS). A WHAN is
    a\r\nwireless technology that links a Home Gateway with\r\nSmart-Home end devices.
    While Wi-Fi is very commonly\r\nused to support broadband subscriber access and\r\nstreaming
    services, the WHANs are typically used to\r\nsupport IOT services where low power
    and security are\r\namong the key requirements. This document provides\r\nguidelines
    for developers of wireless home networking\r\nproducts and for technology associations,
    and allows\r\nservice providers to make a comparison among\r\ntechnologies by
    itemizing specific requirements in the\r\nfollowing technical areas\r\n- installation
    and configuration\r\n-performance\r\n-management and maintenance\r\n-connectivity
    management\r\n-security"
