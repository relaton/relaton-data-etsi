abstract:
- content: "The minimum repertoire and assignment of graphic (letter, digit and special)
    characters to standard 12-key telephone keypads on ICT devices with telephony
    functionality is specified in ES 202 130. \r\nIt applies to public or private,
    fixed or mobile network terminals, without an alphanumeric keyboard but providing
    a 12-key keypad in hardware form (e.g. as push button keys) or software form (e.g.
    as soft keys on a visual display). The ES also applies to network-based services
    accessed through such terminal devices.\r\nES 202 130 complements ETS 300 640
    by additionally including European language-specific letters (Latin, Greek and
    Cyrillic scripts) and other common characters (e.g. the Euro sign and punctuation
    marks). It specifies solutions for both language-independent and language-specific
    keypad assignments, mapped to the 12-key telephone keypad and provides common
    and language-specific information on character repertoires and ordering. \r\nES
    202 130 is fully applicable to the languages of the European Union (EU) member
    states as of 2004 (also covering the official languages of the European Union
    as of June 2004) and the official languages of the EFTA countries and Russian.\r\nThe
    present work item will update ES 202 130 to additionally cover European minority
    languages and major non European languages used in Europe. In addition, languages
    not fully addressed by ES 202 130 will be covered:\r\n• Belarusian, Macedonian
    (the official language of the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia), Serbian
    and Ukrainian (covered by the language-independent Cyrillic-script repertoire);\r\n•
    Albanian (covered by the repertoire specified for e.g. English);\r\n• Moldavian
    (covered by the repertoire specified for Romanian) and\r\n• Croatian (covered
    by the language-independent Latin-script repertoire)."
