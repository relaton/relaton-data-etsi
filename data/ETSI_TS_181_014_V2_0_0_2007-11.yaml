abstract:
- content: "From the characteristics of IPTV services, including Broadcast TV and
    Video on Demand, as specified by other organisations such as the DVB, derive the
    impacts on the TISPAN NGN transport layer and specify the network requirements,
    as relates to the transport layer, to support these services, taking terminal
    capabilities into account.\r\nNote: This specification will not lead to specification
    of a solution that precludes any other non-DVB solution. \r\n"
