  content: "This document defines a smart home system architecture\r\nand derives
    requirements for the Home Gateway. The architecture is described first in terms
    of the entities and\r\ninterfaces of the smart home eco-system, and then in\r\nterms
    of the software execution environment within the\r\nHG. There is a particular
    focus on the Device Abstraction\r\nLayer (DAL) which mediates between high-level\r\napplications
    and the specific local area network protocols\r\nand technologies in the home
    network. In the HGI context,\r\nthe Home Gateway is considered to be the heart
    of the\r\nsmart home  it connects and controls the home\r\nappliances and serves
    as the main entry point for\r\ncommunication with the operators, service providers
    and\r\nutilities in the cloud. The end user has access to their\r\nservices in
    the home either via the cloud or through a\r\ndirect connection to the HG."
