    analyse how much a better IoT Security improves IoT Privacy. Study how classical
    approach (landscaping, gap analysis, recommendations, human-to-machine PIA) based
    on technical standards need to be complemented by non-standard based technical
    measures  of IoT applications/services (massive data, machine-to-machine) to comply
    with IoT Privacy EU framework (ePrivacy Regulation and GDPR).
