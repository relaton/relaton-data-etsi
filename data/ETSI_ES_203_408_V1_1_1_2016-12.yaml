  content: "To define colours and identification of cables and wires used in DC distribution
    systems and installations. To define marking of cables, wires, connectors, any
    associated equipment for DC power distribution. To consider AC conductors colours
    and marking of AC circuits to avoid any confusion and status of the art on colour
    definition for DC cable in ICT equipment. DC includes up to 400VDC EN 300 132-3-1
    or ITU-T L.1200 interface, as well as -48VDC EN 300 132-2 interface. It considers
    the different number of cables including the functional earthing arrangement.\r\n\r\n-----
