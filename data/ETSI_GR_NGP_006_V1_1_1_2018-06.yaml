abstract:
- content: This work item focuses on making a new intelligence-defened network architecture
    and gap analysis towards it. The intelligence techinologies can learn from historical
    data, and make predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static
    program instructions. The IDN can also dynamically adapt to a changing situation
    and enhance their own intelligence with by learning from new data. The integration
    with various network infrastructure, wuch as SDN, NFV&MANO, intelligence router,
    traditional router, is in the scope of this technical proposals.
