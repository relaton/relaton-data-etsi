abstract:
- content: "The present document, specifies PAdES digital signatures. PAdES signatures
    build on PDF signatures specified in ISO 32000-1 with an alternative signature
    encoding to support digital signature formats equivalent to the signature format
    CAdES, by incorporation of signed and unsigned attributes, which fulfil certain
    common requirements (such as the long term validity of digital signatures, for
    instance) in a number of use cases.\r\nThe present document specifies formats
    for PAdES baseline signatures, which provide the basic features necessary for
    a wide range of business and governmental use cases for electronic procedures
    and communications to be applicable to a wide range of communities when there
    is a clear need for interoperability of digital signatures used in electronic
    documents.\r\nThe present document defines four levels of PAdES baseline signatures
    addressing incremental requirements to maintain the validity of the signatures
    over the long term, in a way that a certain level always addresses all the requirements
    addressed at levels that are below it. Each level requires the presence of certain
    PAdES attributes, suitably profiled for reducing the optionality as much as possible.\r\nProcedures
    for creation and validation of PAdES digital signatures are out of scope\r\nThe
    present document aim at supporting electronic signatures in different regulatory
    frameworks.\r\n"
