  content: This work is to specify interoperability tests for IMS-based IPTV Rel.3
    covering all the main IPTV functions via different methods as well as RACS integration
    and new R3 IPTV service procedures. Interoperability tests should include checking
    of high level message flows at key standardized reference points in the TISPAN
    IPTV infrastructure, also including customer premises network.
