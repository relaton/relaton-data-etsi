  script: Latn
  content: 'to establish a new energy efficiency measurement methods and metrics to
    support NFV scenarios, such as IMS and EPC, to define measurement methods for:
    1) VNF, 2)Server, 3) NFVI(NFV Infrastrucutre) including HW and hypervisor. A similar
    work item will be also proposed in ITU-T SG5 for having common deliverables. NOTE:
    the work will look on Network Function Virtualization(NFV) transformation that
    will dramatically change telecom network architecture with decoupled software
    and hardware. Actual available Energy efficient measurement methods of traditional
    all-in-one telecom equipments will be not directly suitable for NFV components
    (e.g. Virtualized Network Functions (VNF), hypervisor hardware, Management and
    Orchestration) from different vendors.'
