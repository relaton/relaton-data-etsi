abstract:
- content: "Recently major efforts have been made by VoLTE component providers to
    inter-connect complete networks, i.e. connecting the single components that comprise
    a VoLTE network of different operators to allow seamless roaming for end customers
    and complete and reliable functionality for network providers. The S1-MME interface
    is a very important point for testing as it typically connects the radio components
    of one vendor to the MME of another vendor making flawless interworking of those
    components essential to the functioning of the network. Beside VoLTE the S1-MME
    interface is also of high importance for local small cell networks and new emerging
    technologies such as M2M communications.\r\nFollowing the methodologies developed
    and used by ETSI this implies the production of multi-part conformance test specification
    documents covering the both the static conformance review (PICS proforma) and
    the dynamic conformance review (Test Purposes, Abstract Test Suite). The result
    would be a complete set of test suites for both the S1AP and the NAS protocols.\r\nETSI
    members have expressed their interest in test specifications related to the S1AP
    and NAS protocol as defined in ETSI TS 136 413 and ETSI TS 124 301 and also declared
    their willingness to review the outputs of this STF and in a later stage in a
    potential follow-up project provide ETSI with the possibility to validate the
    outputs of this STF against their network components (i.e. eNodeB and MME). See
    also list of supporting organisations.\r\n"
