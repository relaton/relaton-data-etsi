  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) defines the interface\r\nbetween
    the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) and the Mobile Equipment\r\n(ME) for use
    during the network operation phase of GSM as well as\r\nthose aspects of the internal
    organisation of the SIM which are\r\nrelated to the network operation phase. This
    is to ensure\r\ninteroperability between a SIM and an ME independently of the\r\nrespective
    manufacturers and operators. The concept of a split of the\r\nMobile Station (MS)
    into these elements as well as the distinction\r\nbetween the GSM network operation
    phase, which is also called GSM\r\noperations, and the administrative management
    phase are described in\r\nthe Technical Specification GSM 02.17 [6].\r\nThis ETS
    defines:\r\n- the requirements for the physical characteristics of the SIM,\r\nthe
    electrical signals and the transmission protocols;\r\n- the model which shall
    be used as a basis for the design of the\r\nlogical structure of the SIM;\r\n-
    the security features;\r\n- the interface functions;\r\n- the commands;\r\n- the
    contents of the files required for the GSM application;\r\n- the application protocol.\r\n
    Unless otherwise stated, references to GSM also apply to DCS 1800.\r\nThis ETS
    does not specify any aspects related to the administrative\r\nmanagement phase.
    Any internal technical realisation of either the SIM\r\nor the ME are only specified
    where these reflect over the interface.\r\nThis ETS does not specify any of the
    security algorithms which may be\r\nused.\r\nThis ETS defines the SIM/ME interface
    for GSM Phase 2. While all\r\nattempts have been made to maintain phase compatibility,
    any issues\r\nthat specifically relate to Phase 1 should be referenced from within\r\nthe
    relevant Phase 1 specification.\r\n"
