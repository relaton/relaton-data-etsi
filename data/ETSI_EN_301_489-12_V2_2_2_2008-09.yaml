abstract:
- content: "This standard has one common requirements part plus specific parts for
    each of the radio equipment and services.  This harmonised standard under the
    EMC Directive and article 3.1b of the R&TTE Dirctive.  This does not include EMC
    requirements for equipment covered by the Marine Equipment Directive. This revision
    is to revise EN 301 489-12 to incorporate requirements for Satellite Earth Stations
    installed on trains. These revisions will be in line with the conclusions reached
    during ERM_EMC#24.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
