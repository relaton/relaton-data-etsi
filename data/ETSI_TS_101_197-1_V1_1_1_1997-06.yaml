abstract:
- content: "Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB);\r\nDVB SimulCrypt\r\nParts 1 and 2 address
    the requirements for interoperability between\r\ntwo or more conditional access
    systems at a head-end.\r\nPart 1 Specifies the system architecture, timing relationships
    and mes\r\nsaging structures.\r\nPart 2 Specifies extended interoperability and
    control.\r\nThe components within the system architecture represent functional
    uni\r\nts. The boundaries between physical equipments units are not required\r\nto
    match exactly the boundaries between functional units. It is possib\r\nle that
    the SCS could be in the MUX or the SCS and MUX could be built\r\nindependently.
    Neither architecture is mandated.\r\n"
