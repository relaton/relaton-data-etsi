abstract:
- content: 'he SEAS reference ontology patterns can be instantiated to create ontologies
    with homogeneous and predictable structures for the modelling and the description
    of any kind of engineering-related data/information/systems. The SEAS reference
    ontology patterns extend and are aligned to the core of the following ontologies:
    W3C&OGC SOSA (Sensing, Observation, Sampling and Actuation) and SSN (Semantic
    Sensor Network), QUDT (Quantity, Unit, Dimension and Type) and SAREF (Smart Applications
    REFerence). The SEAS ontology patterns are applicable to multiple engineering-related
    verticals such as Smart Grids, Micro Grids, Smart Home, Smart Building, Electric
    Mobility, Industry of the Future/Industry 4.0, including all their field devices/processes/systems,
    measurements, environment, actors/players and their relations, as well as flexibility/trading/business
    related aspects. The scope of the present document is to consolidate the SAREF
    ontology, and all the relevant SAREF extensions, adapting the SEAS reference ontology
    patterns, in order to achieve higher semantic interoperability. '
