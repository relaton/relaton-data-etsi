abstract:
- content: "A. Identify Quantum safe primitives.  Identification of proposals from
    industry and academia for quantum safe cryptographic primitives for building key
    establishment, authentication and encryption schemes . This WI will cover Lattice-based,
    Multivariate Quadratic, Code-based, Hash-based and Isogeny-based schemes.\r\n\r\nB.
    Development of a framework for the assessment of quantum safe algorithms.This
    might include consideration of security reductions, forward security and amount
    of public scrutiny of the underlying hardness assumptions.This should also take
    into consideration algorithmic advances in quantum computing. \r\n\r\nC. Recommendations
    on key length to achieve required security levels.\r\n"
