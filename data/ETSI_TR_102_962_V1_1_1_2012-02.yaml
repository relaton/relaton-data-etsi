abstract:
- content: "The scope of the work item is to \r\n\r\n•\tanalyse cooperative ITS services
    using public mobile cellular networks for communications between ITS stations
    in order to identify related functional requirements on the ITS architecture,\r\n\r\n•\tidentify
    required amendments / modifications of existing standards on cooperative ITS in
    order to enable usage of public mobile cellular networks,\r\n\r\n•\tidentify functionality
    to be specified in new ITS standards to be developed under M/453. \r\n\r\nThe
    result is to be presented as an ETSI Technical Report.\r\nStarting from the architecture
    described in the published standard “ITS Communication Architecture”  EN 302 665
    v1.1.1, and considering primarily the “Basic Set of Applications” defined in ETSI
    TR 102 638, a critical assessment of the applicability of the 3G – 4G mobile network
    access to support the described application scenarios will be provided.\r\n\r\nThis
    analysis aims to refer to technical standards developed by 3GPP and ETSI TC M2M
    as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThis analysis is based on the ITS station architecture
    and also covers security aspects.\r\n\r\nAdditional technical background provided
    by R&D projects such as CoCAR (http://www.aktiv-online.org/english/aktiv-cocar.html),
    CoCARx (the follow-on project including integration between LTE and DSRC access
    technologies), and CVIS (http://www.cvisproject.org/) is intended to be considered
    for the development of the Technical Report.\r\n\r\nRelated standards from other
    SDOs working on cooperative ITS also will be considered as appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis
    approach is coherent with the spirit of the \"Joint CEN and ETSI Response to Mandate
    M/453\", with specific reference to clause 3.3. “Standardisation for Co-operative
    systems covering other media” and clause 4.2.3. “National R&D projects including
    national FOTs”.\r\n"
