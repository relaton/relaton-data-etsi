abstract:
- content: This document specifies a reference functional architecture for an end-to-end
    system that delivers linear content over Internet Protocol (IP) networks in a
    scalable and standards-compliant manner. Scalability is achieved by means of IP
    multicast operating in parallel with and alongside conventional unicast delivery.
    The logical functions and the data plane and control plane interfaces between
    them are specified, including a schema for multicast session configuration. Possible
    deployment models and modes of system operation are specified, as well as multicast
    media transport protocols.
