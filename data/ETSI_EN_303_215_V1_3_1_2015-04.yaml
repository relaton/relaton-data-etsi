abstract:
- content: "1) Test condition of small ONU dedicated to installation on outdoor cabinet.
    We need discuss influence of temperature on energy consumption to determine the
    influence of the cooling techniques on the total energy consumption to determine
    if it is necessary change the test condition  and the influence on the target
    value. The result of discussion should be a change of test condition and/or a
    annex that reports the analysis of the high temperature impact on energy consumption
    of ONU.\r\n2) Vectoring functionality measurement methods, it is necessary establish
    the methodologies for measure the energy consumption of equipment with the Vectoring
    functionality activate to verify the conformance to the value establish by the
    future version of the CoC. This activity will consider the work of BBF on definition
    of vectoring test conditions and shall be made in liaison with BBF.\r\n3)Transformation
    of the document in a EN\r\n4)Update of informative annex with target limit or
    deletion if not necessary to update periodically."
