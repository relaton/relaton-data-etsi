abstract:
- content: To study and recommend interworking requirements on the DECT air interface
    for the provision of DECT Packet-switched Streaming Service (DPSS); to identify
    the intended services, applications and requirements (e.g. media types, codecs,
    etc., relevant for speech, natural and synthetic audio, video, still images, bitmap
    graphics, vector graphics, timed text and text) for IP based packet switched access
    networks and local DECT networks; to investigate the best DECT solutions and identify
    further standardisation steps. The UMTS PSS service specifications shall be used
    as much as possible to provide bases for re-use of investment.
