abstract:
- content: " This work item covers AI-based techniques for automatically manipulating
    identity data represented in different media formats, such as audio, video and
    text (deepfakes). The work item describes the different technical approaches and
    analyses the threats posed by deepfakes in different attack scenarios. It then
    provides technical and organisational measures to mitigate these threats and discusses
    their effectiveness and limitations. "
