abstract:
- content: "Work on Machine-to-Machine (M2M) applications has given rise to the possibility
    of having a UICC that is embedded in a communication device in such a way that
    the UICC is not easily accessible or replaceable.  The ability to change network
    subscriptions on such devices becomes problematic, thus necessitating new methods
    for securely and remotely provisioning access credentials on these Embedded UICCs
    (eUICC) and managing subscription changes from one MNO to another. These new methods
    shall take into account that the change of subscription may involve provisioning
    of a new eUICC network access application as well as MNO specific applications,
    and the movement of data stored within the eUICC.  Any changes must preserve the
    industry and end-user benefits that the non-embedded UICC provides today for organizations
    and systems such as GSM, 3GPP, 3GPP2, particularly in terms of security, flexibility
    in business relationships, logistics, and end-user experience.\r\nThe expression
    \"Embedded UICC\" refers to a UICC that is not intended to be removed from or
    replaced in the terminal.\r\nThis Work Item proposes to identify and analyse a
    representative set of use cases that will provide the key requirements for the
    development of a trusted framework for the management of an embedded UICC, and
    to create CRs against ETSI TS 102 412.\r\nThe scope of work to be undertaken covers
    the following:\r\nÂ·Defining use cases and corresponding requirements for remote
    personalization and subscription management of such an Embedded UICC including
    its integration in telecommunication network infrastructures.\r\nIt is expected
    that the use cases will identify aspects that need to be standardised by other
    organisations such as 3GPP, 3GPP2 and GlobalPlatform.\r\nAn illustrative set of
    use cases and requirements are provided in the GSMA document accompanying this
    Work Item; Embedded SIM Task Force Requirements and Use Cases V1.0 GSMA 21 February
    2011 found in SCPREQ(11)0018/SCP(11)0088.\r\n\r\nSupporting ETSI Member organisations:\r\nAT&T\r\nDeutsche
