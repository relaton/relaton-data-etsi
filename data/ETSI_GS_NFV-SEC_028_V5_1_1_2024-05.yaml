    as part of the NFV Release 5. This edition will add requirements to support the
    Release 5 features. The scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nThis
    work item focuses on the security assurance of NFV-MANO products and introduces
    the security assurance methodology from 3GPP specifications in NFV. Using the
    security requirements defined in other SEC specs (i.e., ETSI GS NFV-SEC 014, ETSI
    GS NFV-SEC0 24, ETSI GS NFV-SEC 025), security test cases including testing goals,
    testing steps, and evidence of testing results for evaluating whether the security
    requirements are implemented by NFV-MANO based products are described."
