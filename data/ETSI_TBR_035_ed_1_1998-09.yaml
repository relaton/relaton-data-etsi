abstract:
- content: "This TBR specifies the technical characteristics to be provided by\r\nTETRA
    terminal equipment which is capable of connection to a Public\r\nTelecommunications
    Network (PTN) and which uses the TETRA technology.\r\nThe objective of this TBR
    is to ensure that no disturbance occurs\r\nto the PTN, and to ensure interworking
    btw. PTN and TETRA terminals\r\nand btw. TETRA terminal to TETRA terminal so that
    the communication\r\ncan be routed successfully through the applicable network(s).\r\nThe
    requirements in this TBR apply together with the attachment\r\nrequirements for
    the appropriate PTN and the requirement of any other\r\napplicable TBR. It does
    not add or reduce the attachment requirements\r\nunless there is a particular
    effect on the network which is unique to\r\nTETRA.\r\nNote: appropriate PTN refers
    to TBR for basic rate ISDN, TBR for\r\nprimary rate ISDN or national regulations
    (implemeting ETS 300 001)\r\nfor PSTN.\r\n TETRA terminal equipment consists of
    several elements. This TBR is\r\nstructured to allow testing and approval of the
    individual elements\r\nas separate items. Because of the need for effective use
    of the radio\r\nfrequency spectrum, the essential air interface characteristics
    shall\r\nbe tested. For each essential requirement, a test is given including\r\nmeasurement
    methods.\r\nRequirements apply to the public network interface and the RF Air\r\nInterface
    of the equipment, which may be stimulated to perform the\r\ntests by additional
    equipment, if necessary.\r\nTerminal equipment may be subject to additional requirements
    in other\r\napplicable CTRs or Directives depending on the functionality (primary\r\nfunctions).\r\nThis
    TBR is based on the radio and protocol provisions of ETS 300 394.\r\nThis document
    is a general TBR for TETRA terminal equipment, however,\r\nonly certain applications
    are subject to Directive 91/263/EEC and\r\nhence covered by a CTR. It is therefore
    necessary to check with the\r\nrelevant CTR as to the applicability to specific
    applications.\r\n  "
