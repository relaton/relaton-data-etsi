    a GSM PLMN in connection with other networks as a\r\nbasis for the definition
    of the network capabilities required.\r\nThe descriptions of the different supplementary

    services not covered in GSM 02.04 or GSM 02.80 series\r\ncannot be introduced
    unilaterally in any GSM PLMN if they require\r\nmodification of the GSM signalling
    Specifications.\r\nTechnical realization of supplementary services is described
    in\r\nSpecifications GSM 03.11 and 04.10.\r\n "
