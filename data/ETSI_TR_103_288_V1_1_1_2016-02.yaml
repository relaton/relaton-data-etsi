    Technical Report(s) in response to the Commission letter of 13 February 2013:
    \r\n·To investigate and document anticipated and/or planned changes in frequency
    use in the bands 174 MHz - 230 MHz and 470 MHz - 862 MHz including the relevant
    characteristics of the expected radio technologies to be deployed in these and
    neighbouring bands. \r\n·To develop a description of the emerging electromagnetic
    environment in the above bands and evaluate how these changes will affect the
    co-existence services, systems and equipment. \r\n·Make recommendations to the
    CENELEC and ETSI committees to revise affected Harmonised Standards and other
    European Standards as necessary to improve to co-existence of relevant services
    and equipment."
