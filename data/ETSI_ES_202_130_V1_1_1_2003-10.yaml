abstract:
- content: "This activity will identify a common as well as a language specific assignment
    and access solution for European characters from the 12-key telephone pads, including
    sorting orders.  Most common glyphs-e.g. the Euro sign- and punctuation marks
    will be included.\r\nGreek characters and a solution for Cyrillic will be fully
    supported.\r\nThe main output will be an ETSI Standard which is intended to later
    form the basis for a European Norm."
