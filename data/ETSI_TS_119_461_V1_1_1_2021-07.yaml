  content: "This document specifies policy and security requirements for a trust service
    component providing identity proofing of trust service subjects.  This can be
    used for conformity assessment of a trust service provider which includes this
    service component as part of its service or can be used for conformity assessment
    of a specialised provider of identity proofing supporting other trust service
    providers.\r\n   \r\nThe document specifies best practices for security supporting
    different technological approaches, and possibly for different assurance levels.
