abstract:
- content: "The present document is a complete revision of V1.1.1. The framework that
    has been defined in V1.1.1. has not been applied due to its complexity. Therefore
    the Conditional Access signalling and transport mechanisms have been redefined
    and restructured. On the one hand the concept provides Conditional Access on different
    transport levels and therefore covers a large scope of demands. On the other hand
    the concept is aimed to be as simple as possible and easy to apply. Existing DAB
    signalling structures are used. Backwards compatibility to existing receivers
    that do not support Conditional Access is achieved. \r\n"
