abstract:
- content: "The TR will provide information on the existing and future intended UWB
    applications in the operational band up to 12,4 GHz with the focus onto the 8,5
    GHz to 12,4 GHz band extension. It will also provide an overview over the relevant
    possible mitigation techiques and factors to protect existing and future services
    in the band 8,5 GHz to 12,4 GHz. The information in the TR will complement and
    extend the information included in TR 103 314.\r\nA specific emphasis will be
    put onto the investigations of passive services in the band 10,68 GHz to 10,7
    GHz and the X-band radionavigation and radiolocation systems  in the band above
    8,5 GHz.\r\nThe present document includes necessary information to support the
    co-operation between ETSI and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of
    the European Conference of Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT).
