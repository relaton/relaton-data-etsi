abstract:
- content: This GS specifies the F5G security countermeasure framework derived from
    the accompanying F5G GR security gap/threat analysis recommendations. The GS identifies
    and defines the application of mechanisms as appropriate for assurance of the
    Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability (CIA) paradigm across all three planes
    of the F5G architecture. In addition, this work item determines the need for modification
    for the F5G application. This work is developed in parallel with partners across
    ETSI (ENI, SAI, CYBER, NFV and others as appropriate).
