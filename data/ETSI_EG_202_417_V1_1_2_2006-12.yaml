  content: The proposed ETSI Guide (EG) will give guidance on minimum standards for
    user education (paper-based and electronic; on-line and stand-alone; textual,
    visual and spoken). The EG attempts at ensuring that (a) user guides are appropriate
    for the users' level of expertise and cognitive abilities, (b) media or a media
    mix are being used that benefit the largest possible range of users, and (c) user
    guides are structured in a way to offer good navigation throughout the guide.
    An additional outcome is a common platform for user instructions documents to
    enable third-party manufacturers to develop tools for generating special variants
    of a user guide for specific requirements.
