  content: This work item will study the driving forces and the characteristics of
    fixed network evolution from F5G towards F5G Advanced. This will include all segments
    of E2E connectivity between on-premises networks and data centers. It will extend
    and enhance the F5G concepts and characteristics initially described in ETSI GR
    F5G 001 V1.1.1 (2020-12). The WI will identify and detail the characteristics
    of F5G Advanced including energy efficiency.
