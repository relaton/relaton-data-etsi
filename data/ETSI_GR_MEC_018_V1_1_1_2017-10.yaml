  content: This work item focuses on mobility support provided by Mobile Edge Computing.
    The work item will document mobility use cases and end to end information flows
    to support UE and Application mobility for Mobile Edge Computing. Based on this,
    a study will identify gaps to support mobility that are not covered by existing
    WIs, and document these gaps. When necessary, this may include identifying new
    mobile edge services or interfaces, as well as changes to existing mobile edge
    services or interfaces, data models, application rules and requirements. The work
    item will recommend the necessary normative work to close these gaps. The document
    produced will be an informative GS.
