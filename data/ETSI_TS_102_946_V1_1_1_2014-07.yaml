  content: This Technical Specification defines system requirements for operation
    in UHF TV band white spaces. The requirements are stemming mostly from the use
    cases described in Technical Report 102 907 Use cases for Operation in White Space
    Frequency Bands.  The scope of the work in this TS is to define system level requirements
    related to operation of secondary cognitive radio systems and devices operating
    on UHF TV band white spaces. At minimum this TS shall define requirements based
    on which the coexistence system architecture, TS 102 908 Coexistence Architecture
    for Cognitive Radio Networks on UHF WS Frequency Bands, can be specified.
