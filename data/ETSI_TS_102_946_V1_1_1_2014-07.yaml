abstract:
- content: This Technical Specification defines system requirements for operation
    in UHF TV band white spaces. The requirements are stemming mostly from the use
    cases described in Technical Report 102 907 “Use cases for Operation in White
    Space Frequency Bands”.  The scope of the work in this TS is to define system
    level requirements related to operation of secondary cognitive radio systems and
    devices operating on UHF TV band white spaces. At minimum this TS shall define
    requirements based on which the coexistence system architecture, TS 102 908 “Coexistence
    Architecture for Cognitive Radio Networks on UHF WS Frequency Bands”, can be specified.
