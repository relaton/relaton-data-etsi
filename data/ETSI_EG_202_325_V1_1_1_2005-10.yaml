abstract:
- content: "Effective user profile management will be critical to the uptake and success
    of new and advanced communication services and it is therefore important to focus
    on the users' requirements in this area. The objective of the work item is to
    produce an ETSI Guide (EG), establishing a set of guidelines relevant to users
    and their need to manage their user profiles for personalisation of services and
    terminals to provide efficient communications. The ETSI Guide will describe a
    conceptual framework in which user profiles can be considered.\r\n\r\nThe following
    key areas are addressed:\r\n                        ·The user profile concept.\r\n
    \                       ·Administering sub-profiles that reflect users' lifestyles
    and different situations.\r\n                        ·The benefits of user profiles
    to different parties.\r\n                        ·Scenarios in which user profiles
    may bring benefits.\r\n                        ·Administering automatic activation
