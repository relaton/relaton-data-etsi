abstract:
- content: "This Global System for Mobile communications Technical Specification (\r\nGTS)
    gives the principles on which the detailed interface specificatio\r\nns in the
    rest of the GSM 08.0X series of Technical Specifications are\r\nbased.\r\nThe
    set of fixed equipment accessed from the MSC through one particula\r\nr instance
    of the interface will be later referred to as a Base Statio\r\nn System (BSS).
    A BSS ensures the coverage of n cells, where n can be\r\n1 or more.\r\nThe function
    of a BSS may be further subdivided into a control functio\r\nn, performed by one
    Base Station Controller (BSC) and a transceiving f\r\nunction, performed by \"n\"
    Base Transceiver Station equipments (BTS), o\r\nne for each cell. However, the
    study of such a split is outside the sc\r\nope of the 08.0x series of Technical
    Specifications, where the BSS wil\r\nl be considered as a whole.\r\nThe BSS-MSC
    interface defined in the GSM 08 series of Technical Specif\r\nications is designed
    to support a wide range of possible architectures\r\non both sides. Characteristics
    like the physical location of the tran\r\nscoders/rate adaptation inside the BSS
    (either integrated into the tra\r\nnsceivers or very near to the MSC) or the use
    of traffic or signalling\r\nconcentration at either side are left to the operators
    choice. Annex\r\nA to this Technical Specification contains guidance information
    concer\r\nning the use of remote mobile switching units, which for the purposes\r\nof
    this specification are considered as part of the MSC.\r\nDirect connection between
    two BSSs is not supported by this interface.\r\nThis interface is based on the
    use of 1 or more 2 048 kbit/s digital t\r\nransmission system interfaces. Each
    2 048 kbit/s interface provides 31\r\n*64 kbit/s channels which can be used for
    traffic or signalling as the\r\noperator requires.\r\nThe signalling is layured,
    terminology similar to that in the OSI refe\r\nrence model is used in this series,
    however the layers referred to are\r\nnot identical to the equivalently named
    layer in the OSI model.\r\nThis interface is defined at the boundary of the MSC
    and has a per cha\r\nnnel bit rate of 64 kbit/s, but the net radio path traffic
    channel is\r\nat a rate of less than 16 kbit/s. A transcoder or rate adapter functio\r\nn
    is thus needed for the rate conversion. The interface is designed su\r\nch that
    the transcoding or rate adaptation function may be geographica\r\nlly situated
    at either the MSC site or the BSS site, however the trans\r\ncoder is considered
    to be part of the BSS.\r\nThe interface has been designed around the aims of GSM
    08.01 allowing\r\neach component and the system as a whole to evolve.\r\n "
