abstract:
- content: "Specification of mIa, dIa and mId interfaces as for ETSI TS 102 690, in
    terms of protocols/API, the data model and the coding. Existing specification
    (e.g. for the coding), may be also referenced. The data models related to the
    applications are not part of this specification.\r\nThe 3 mentioned interfaces
    are expected to have commonalities in term of stage 3 definition, so one single
    TS is currently envisaged, but the possible split (one TS for each interface)
    will be evaluated when this specification will become stable."
