  content: 'The detailed scope of this NWI on RIS diversity and multiplexing is to:  (i)
    Identify use cases and deployment scenarios of RIS-based diversity and multiplexing
    schemes. (ii) Investigate feasible diversity and multiplexing schemes for different
    RIS hardware (active, passive, etc.) and RIS operating modes (reflection, refraction,
    etc.) for RIS-aided systems (iii) Investigate transmitter and receiver (.g. UE)
    complexity increase or reduction potential for the various multiplexing schemes
    (iv) Evaluate the characteristics of RIS-aided channels for different diversity
    schemes (v) Analyze the performance gains provided by RIS diversity and multiplexing
    schemes (vi) Study the impact on channel estimation / CSI acquisition due to diversity
    and multiplexing schemes involving RIS'
