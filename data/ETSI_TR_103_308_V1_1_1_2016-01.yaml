abstract:
- content: The lawful interception capability is capable of being virtualised but
    the legal and physical challenges of doing so must be taken into account. The
    initial study is focused on the LI aspects.The challenge for both Lawful Interception
    and NFV as a community is that it is necessary to establish the fundamental security
    principles for generic platforms upon which the related groups can build. There
    is an urgent requirement to establish a minimum set of security principles for
    generic telecommunications platforms that will allow the virtualised network functions
    to utilise the features necessary to afford them appropriate protection and at
    the same time allow to undertake appropriate activities (LI, fraud management,
    cyber defense). Establishing such a baseline will help the industry as a whole
    to be better protected against Cyber threats.There is no overlap with other work
    e.g. SECAM â€“ in fact the work is intended to be complementary. The focus of this
    work item is on the NFV infrastructure and not virtual network functions.
