abstract:
- content: "The amended TR provides information on the applications, technical parameters
    and the radio spectrum requirements for UWB Object Discrimination and Characterization
    applications for powertool devices operating in the frequency band from 2,2 GHz
    to 8 GHz.\r\nThe applications will allow operators to handle materials in close
    proximity to the powertool with enhanced safety .\r\nThere are 2 different applications:\r\nApplication
    1: Sensing and position detection of human tissue (extremities) for user- safety
    applications, e.g. for tooling equipment ( e.g. table top saw).\r\nApplication
    2: Measure the thickness of materials and penetrate materials for \"Break through\"
    protection and avoid direct contact for building, construction type work (e.g.
    drilling machine); pre-impact detection."
