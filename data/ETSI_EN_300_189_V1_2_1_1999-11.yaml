abstract:
- content: "This standard defines the requirements for the handling of network addresses
    for the identification of entities which use or provide telecommunications services
    offered by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). This standard covers
    numbering, including the requirements for the support of a Private Numbering Plan,
    the addressing of network service access points for open systems interconnection
    (OSI NSAP addresing), and the support of subaddressing.\r\nThis standard is applicable
    to Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges with broadband and narrowband
    capabilities (PINX) and to terminals to be attached to the access of PINXs. Any
    use by a PINX of the support of Private Numbering Plans supplementary service
    provided by a public ISDN is outside the scope of this standard.\r\nAlthough this
    standard does not explicitly describe its application to location-independent
    (mobile) addressable entities, this application is not precluded.\r\n\r\nReference
