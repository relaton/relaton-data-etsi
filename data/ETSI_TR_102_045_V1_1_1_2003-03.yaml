  content: "Further work on signature policies shall elaborate in a presentable manner
    on the signature policy concept address certain aspects of multiple signatures
    and if necessary propose extensions of the standard. \r\nThe objective of the
    first part of the deliverable is to identify the business requirements, while
    the second part is to specify the necessary extensions of TS 101 733 (and the
    corresponding RFC) to satisfy those requirements.\r\nIdentification of business
    requirements\r\nThere is a requirement to address specific trade transactions,
    such as the UN Trade Transactions Model or ad hoc models, such as the notary example
    etc. where multiple (i.e. more than one) signatures are used. \r\nThis part shall
    focus on the implications of signature policies in various types of transactions
    or unilateral declarations. This work item shall focus on the roles, documents
    used, formalities, and relationships (e.g. concurrency and their implications
    in multiple signatures). \r\nItem will address transactions and their implications
    to identify relationships among the various implicated elements that include roles,
    documents, data etc. \r\nExtension requirements on signature policies\r\nOn the
    basis of part one the work group shall evaluate the conditions of application
    and make specific proposals for amendments on the existing ETSI standard describing
    an optional format for signature policies. \r\nThe work shall also include drafting
    and managing the comments and working drafts of IETF comments and promotion within
    IETF. \r\n"
