  content: "This TCR-TR will identify major areas of common concern regarding\r\nthe
    use of a number of different architecture and service description\r\nmethodologies
    in ETSI and the consequences of this situation\r\ncontinuing. It will recommend
    an approach to the harmonisation of\r\narchitecture and service descriptions and
    identify the joint working\r\nnecessary between STCs to achieve this. It will
    also identify the\r\nexpected benefits of these recommendations.\r\n  "
