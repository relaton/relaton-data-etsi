abstract:
- content: The present document provides the framework for further standardisation
    for the creation and validation of advanced electronic signatures (AdES) in mobile
    environments (i.e. in environments where mobile devices are supported by networked
    services for signature creation and/or validation) taking into account recent
    improvements in the capabilities of mobile devices and their overlap with the
    capabilities other computing devices.  It identifies the recommended scope of
    such standards and any suggested provision thought appropriate to these standards.
