  content: "Update TS 102 573 v1.1.1 as follows:\r\n1) broaden the scope from \"Policy
    requirements for trust service providers signing and/or storing data for digital
    accounting\" to service providers signing and/or storing any kind of data supporting
    implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC, Art. 26, where EUMS are required to take
    accompanying measures to encourage providers to take action on a voluntary basis
    in order to ensure the quality of service provision. \r\n2) reference only to
    \"data\" or \"data object\", as applicable, in place of \"document\" or \"information\"
    when referring to data stored and/or signed by service providers in scope of TS
    102 573 to align with TS 101 533-1 and TR 101 533-2 version 1.2.1 onward."
