abstract:
- content: "A GR to study how the location of sensitive VNFs (e.g. LI functions, VNFs
    handling data with Data Protection location handling restrictions and network
    security functions) can be attested.\r\nThe study will consider using trusted
    locstamp and timestamp information derived from Global Navigation Satellite Systems
    (GNSS), such as Galileo. The study will also consider other physical location
    binding solutions. The work is expected to also have benefits for other less sensitive
    virtualised services which may need to verify location of VNFs or data. The result
    of work is expected to be informative.\r\n"
