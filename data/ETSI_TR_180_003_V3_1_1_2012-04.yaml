abstract:
- content: "The present document provides guidance for handling IMS-based NGN national
    IP interconnection details.\r\nInterconnection of  NGNs represents a broad area
    of study including such areas as signalling interconnection, media interconnection,
    routing, address resolution, security, charging and network management. However,
    as with most aspects of the NGN, there are many Standards Development Organizations
    (SDOs) and industry bodies that are working on this topic. \r\nAs organizations
    such as ITU-T, 3GPP, GSMA and the i3 Forum do focus on overarching IP interconnection
    specifications and agreements, a gap on guidelines for the handling of national
    IP interconnection was identified. This document is intended to fill this gap
    for IMS based NGN national IP interconnection in co-relation with the IMS approach
    of 3GPP.\r\n"
