abstract:
- content: "This technical specification (TS) contains the Abstract Test Suite (ATS)
    to test the ERM; Digital Mobile Radio (DMR) as defined in Air Interface specification
    TS 102361-1 v1.2.1, Voice and Generic Services and Facilities specification TS
    102361-2 v1.2.1, Data specification TS 102361-3 v1.1.1 and Trunking specification
    TS 102361-4 v1.1.1.\r\nThe objective of this test specification is to provide
    a basis for conformance tests for ERM DMR equipment giving a high probability
    of air interface inter-operability between different manufacturer's ERM DMR equipment.\r\nThe
    ISO standard for the methodology of conformance testing (ISO/IEC 9646-1 and ISO/IEC
    9646-2) as well as the ETSI rules for conformance testing (ETS 300 406) are used
    as a basis for the test methodology."
