abstract:
- content: EN xxx XXX -1 and -2 will be developed to address a new technology in the
    medical field that will enhance the quality of life for afflicted patients and,
    in many cases, potentially save their life.  This technology is a radically new
    concept for providing highly accurate real time vascular blood pressure level
    information from an ULP-AMI membrane implant transmitter that is embedded in a
    patient undergoing vascular surgery.  This type of information is not currently
    available with any type of non-invasive technology.  These systems cannot be properly
    tested to show conformance with the applicable legislation under any existing
    ETSI standards owing to the frequency range, the method of energy coupling, tissue
    absorption, and other factors.
