abstract:
- content: "The deliverable will define communication requirements and profiles to
    support communications from/to ITS-S stations (e.g. fixed road side ITS-S, mobile
    ITS-S) for the support of security management services specified in TS 102 941
    (i.e. certificate management, trust and revocation lists distribution). \r\nThe
    deliverable will also define the related protocol handling for the selected messages
    as well as the requirements for the lower layer protocol stacks and for the security
    processing services sub-entity in order to support message dissemination and reception."
