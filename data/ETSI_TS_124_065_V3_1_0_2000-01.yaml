  content: "The user of the services provided by SNDCP is a packet data protocol (PDP)
    at the mobile Station (MS) or the Relay at the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN).
    Additionally, a control entity, e.g., AT command interpreter, may be an SNDCP
    user. SNDCP uses the services provided by the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer
    and the Session Management (SM) sub-layer.\r\nThe main functions of SNDCP are:\r\n-Multiplexing
    of several PDPs.\r\n-Compression/ decompression of user data.\r\n-Compression/
    decompression of protocol control information.\r\n-Segmentation of a network protocol
    data unit (N-PDU) into Logical Link Control Protocol Data Units (LL-PDUs) and
    re-assembly of LL-PDUs into a N-PDU.\r\nGSM04.65 is applicable to GPRS MS and
    SGSN."
