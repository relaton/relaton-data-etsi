abstract:
- content: The objective of this WI is to specify the protocols used on the reference
    points   defined for the Customer Network Device enabling the  IMS-based IPTV
    service usage. The activity will be carried out on the basis of the stage 2 specifications
    related to the IPTV CND produced by WG5 (WI05018, TS 185 009), will take into
    account the protocol suites already defined for the reference points between the
    CPN itself and the NGN and also the architectural specifications of the Customer
    Network Gateway (WI05012, TS 185 003). This activity will require a strict cooperation
    with WI-05019 and with WG3 to check the coherence with the overall definition
    of protocols for the IMS-based IPTV.
