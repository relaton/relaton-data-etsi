abstract:
- content: "To develop technical specification that cover requirements for the delivery
    of Cable based services to the devices in the home across a home access. This
    will cover the delivery of Cable based services across home access networks to
    the devices of consumption in the home. The specification focuses on the higher
    layer specifications and is not to cover the various physical transmission technologies
    that are developed by other organisations but to use these transport mechanisms
    to deliver Cable based services to the terminals in the home. The requirements
    produced are to be abstract and not device specific.\r\n"
