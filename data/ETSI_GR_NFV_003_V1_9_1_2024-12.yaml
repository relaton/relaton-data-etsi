  content: This document intends to provide terms and definitions for conceptual entities
    with the scope of the NFV work, in order to achieve a common language across all
    the NFV working groups and for wider industry discussions on this topic. It should
    be noted, that terminology, architecture and requirements very much depend on
    each other, and that this document may need to be revised to align with the content
    of various group specifications and iterations of the documents produced by the
    ISG.
