abstract:
- content: "This Technical Basis for Regulation (TBR) specifies the technical\r\nrequirements
    to be met by terminal equipment capable of connecting to\r\na public telecommunications
    network. These requirements apply to\r\nterminals for Phase 2 of the public land
    mobile radio service,\r\noperating in the 900 MHz band with a channel separation
    of 200 kHz,\r\nutilising constant envelope modulation and carrying traffic channels\r\naccording
    to the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) principle.\r\nThis TBR specifies the
    requirements for GSM Telephony (speech) for the\r\nGSM900 version of the Global
    System for Mobile communications (GSM).\r\nFor each test purpose and its corresponding
    conformance requirement, a\r\nreference is given to ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1)
    [2]. The\r\nrequirements apply to speech transmission.\r\nThe measurement uncertainty
    is handled, as described in ETS 300 607-1\r\n(GSM 11.10-1) [2].\r\nThis TBR covers
    the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive\r\n91/263/EEC [1] Article
    4g. Articles 4d, 4e, and 4f are covered by TBR\r\n19.\r\nThe Terminal Directive
    91/263/EEC Articles 4a and 4b are covered by\r\nother directives, and, therefore,
    not by this TBR.\r\nIn this TBR, there are no Electromagnetic Compatibility technical\r\nrequirements
    in terms of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC, Article\r\n4c.\r\nNOTE: Technical
    Requirements for EMC performance and testing of the\r\nequipment are covered by
    the relevant standards applicable to the EMC\r\nDirective 89/336/EEC, Annex A.\r\nTerminal
    equipment may be subject to additional requirements in other\r\nCommon Technical
    Regulations (CTR) depending on the equipments\r\nfunctionality.\r\nETS 300 607-1
    (GSM 11.10-1) [2] constitutes the conformance test suite\r\nfor GSM. The verification
    of the conformance requirements in this TBR\r\nis based on the tests described
    in this ref rence. The set of\r\nrequirements in ETS 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2]
    and the set of\r\nrequirements in this TBR need not be identical.\r\nSome requirements
    only apply to specific types of mobile station (e.g.\r\ndata tests only apply
    to mobile stations with a data facility). The\r\nTBR also indicates the specific
    test which shall be carried out for\r\neach mobile station type.\r\nAn active
    accessory is covered by this TBR if it modifies the terminal\r\nperformance in
    an aspect which affects conformance to essential\r\nrequirements.\r\nNOTE: Only
    active devices are subject to this TBR. Accessories may be\r\ntested with specific
    terminals, and either approved for use with those\r\nterminals only, or may possibly
    be approved for use with a wider range\r\nof terminals, depending on the nature
    and effect of the accessory.\r\n"
