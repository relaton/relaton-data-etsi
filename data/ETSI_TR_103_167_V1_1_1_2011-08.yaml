  content: "Threats against M2M functional architecture, Service layer and interfaces
    need to be identified and analysed for impact and for likelihood. The need for
    countermeasures needs to be determined. Results of the WI should be maintained
    as informative text within a Technical Report.\r\n\r\nThe scope of threat analysis
    will consider only the following two types of threat (with the following order
    of priority): \r\n\r\n1.\tType 1 threats:  threats that are specific to M2M service
    layer or interfaces for the service layer. \r\n2.\tType 2 threats:  threats that
    may not be specific to M2M service layer but which have a significant impact upon
    M2M functional requirements. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the level of risk (i.e. combined
    likelihood and impact) of identified threats will also be evaluated.  As a result
    of that, there will be a prioritisation of threats and therefore of countermeasures
    and security requirements. \r\n\r\nConcerning countermeasures identified in this
    WI, the scope will include :\r\n\tconsideration of merits and demerits (i.e. pros
    and cons) of identified countermeasures;\r\n\tevaluation of countermeasures to
    determine (1) the need for a standardised solution/implementation, (2) availability
    of existing standardised solutions (e.g. from other SDOs), (3) the need for a
    new standardised solution (either from another SDO or from ETSI M2M).\r\nContent
    in the new TR may lead to new requirements in future releases of TS 102 689 and
    normative text in TS 102 690. "
