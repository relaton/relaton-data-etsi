  content: "Within TISPAN Release 1 WG8 agreed (on the TISPAN level) that the objects
    of WG8 standardization are the NGN OSS Service Interfaces (NOSIs). WG8 has not
    yet a clear proceeding on how to develop NOSIs from an idea to standard documents.\r\nThe
    scope of the Specification Guidelines work item is to capture the status quo of
    developing ideas to NOSIs, to identify and to clarify the purpose of implicitly
    existing sub-steps, to direct ongoing work, and, finally to put on record the
    WG8 internal way how to develop NOSIs from ideas to standard documents. The documentation
    of the latter step are the WG8 Specification Guidelines. In terms of documents
    these guidelines will be the output of this work item."
