  content: "ES 202 050  defines the standard for the Advanced Distributed Speech Recognition
    front-end (AFE). The purpose of this new work item is to enable improved performance
    for tonal language recognition and provide the ability to reconstruct a speech
    waveform from the AFE DSR parameters. To achieve this additional parameters(less
    than 1kbit/s) containing fundamental frequency information for the speech will
    be transmitted to supplement the 4.8kbit of data sent for the AFE features.\r\nThis
    standard will define the encoder to be used to create the additional parameters
    to be sent, the compression of these parameters and the decoder that can generate
    a speech waveform from them.\r\nThe analysis performed at the encoder will provide
    fundamental frequency information that is suitable for use in speech recognition
    systems for tonal languages. The processing that will be used to create the tonal
    feature parameters eventually used by a recogniser is not part of this standard.
    The decoding of the received parameters together with the DSR cepstra to recreate
    a speech waveform will also be defined within this workitem and become a standard.\r\n"
