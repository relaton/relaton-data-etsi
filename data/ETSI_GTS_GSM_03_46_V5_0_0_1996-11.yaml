abstract:
- content: "This Global System for Mobile communications Technical Specification (\r\nGTS)
    deals with the procedures allowing the technical realization of t\r\nhe real time
    end-to-end facsimile group 3 service within the GSM PLMN\r\nusing non-transparent
    network support according to the definition of t\r\nhe Teleservices 61 and 62
    specified in GSM 02.03. Within this document\r\nparticular attention is given
    to Teleservice \"Alternate speech/facsim\r\nile group 3\" (Teleservice 61). However,
    the definitions apply also to\r\nTeleservice \"Automatic facsimile group 3\" (Teleservice
    62) with the ex\r\nception of all actions concerned with the speech phase. Consequently,\r\nin
    the following descriptions the term \"Teleservice\" denotes both Tele\r\nservice
    61 and Teleservice 62 as appropriate.\r\nNOTE: Some facilities associated with
    alternate speech/ facsimile grou\r\np 3 may not be available with version 1 of
    MAP. In particular, the in-\r\ncall modification procedure following an inter
    MSC handover is not sup\r\nported by this version. This imposes the limitation
    that for all calls\r\nit will not be possible to change between speech and facsimile
    follow\r\ning an inter MSC handover.\r\n "
