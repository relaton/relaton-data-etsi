abstract:
- content: This WI will build upon industrial use cases identified in GR ARF 002 and
    develop requirements for the interoperability of AR components, systems, and services.
    This deliverable is part 4 of a multipart document covering the interoperability
    requirements developed for some of the reference points specified in the ARF reference
    architecture GS ARF 003. Part 4 relates to the specification of the high level
    Reference Point requirements between the World Analysis and World Storage (AR10
    “3D Map” and AR11 “Relocalization Information”) and between the World Analysis
    and the Scene Management (AR8 “Pose”).
