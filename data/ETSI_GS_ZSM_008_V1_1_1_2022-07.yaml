abstract:
- content: "The work item will investigate the management of  end to end (E2E) services
    across management domains (MDs).\r\n\r\nIt will define the management processes
    during the lifecycle of E2E services (covering onboarding, fulfilment and assurance)
    and will describe the interactions between E2E service management domain and management
    domains. Furthermore, it will map the management services used in the management
    processes to the north bound interfaces of selected technology domains, and references
    the underlying specifications of these interfaces to enable the automation of
    lifecycle management across domains.\r\n\r\nThe deliverable will be a stage 2
    normative document based on the reference architecture and refer to available
    standards and open source outputs where appropriate. Network slicing is covered
    in ZSM003 and will be referenced in this work item. Closed loops are covered in
    ZSM009-x and will be referenced in this work item."
