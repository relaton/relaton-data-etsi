abstract:
- content: The present document provides information on use cases of vertical sectors
    with specific characteristics of spectrum usage and access, such as audio PMSE,
    e-health, wireless industrial automation, PPDR, intelligent transport system,
    car test track, and drone control and payload, and introduces various spectrum
    sharing frameworks, including standardized architectures, such as LSA, eLSA, and
    CBRS, standardized technology specific protocols, e.g. Listen Before Talk, Detect
    And Avoid, and Dynamic Channel Selection, and spectrum allocation procedures,
    such as audio PMSE frameworks and National Local Licensing.
