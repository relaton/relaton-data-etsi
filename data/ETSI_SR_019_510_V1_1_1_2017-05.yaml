abstract:
- content: The objective of this work item is to specify the general requirements
    with respect to long-term data preservation and clearly identify which are the
    “objects” whose preservation falls in the scope of a preservation service as defined
    by the Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 and which objects are outside the scope of
    the Regulation but worth to be considered, the set of processes and technologies
    to be supported by a preservation service provider and the different types of
    preservation service provider, a catalogue of existing specifications and standards,
    a list of well-established and active communities in the fields of archival and
    preservation (possible candidates for liaisons) and an extension to the Rationalised
    Framework (RF) specifically targeted to data preservation services and providers
    to identify any additional standard or technical specification beyond those already
    specified by RF. The Scoping study and framework for standardization will be supporting
    the (qualified) preservation services as per Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and also
    preservation services with a broader scope for industry at the International level.
