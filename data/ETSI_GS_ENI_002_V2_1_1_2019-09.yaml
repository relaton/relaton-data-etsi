  content: "This document specifies the requirements related to ENI.  This includes
    the common requirements for both fixed and mobile, fixed specific requirements
    and mobile specific requirements. The ENI requirements are based on the ENI use
    case document and identified requirements from other SDOs. These requirements
    will form the base for the architecture design work. \r\n \r\nThis revision will
    update the existing requirements where needed and add new functional and non-functional,
    security and architectural requirements."
