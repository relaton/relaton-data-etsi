  content: "The present document identifies the Interworking Functions (IWF's) and
    requirements for the interworking between a GSM PLMN and a Packet Switched Public
    Data Network/Integrated Services Digital Network (PSPDN/ISDN) for the support
    of packet services in GSM PLMNs.\r\nIn the GSM PLMN context the packet services
    are associated with bearer services and are described in GSM02.02. The generally
    defined GSM PLMN user-network access as defined in the respective GSM specifications
    (see references) forms the basis for defining the particularities for the provision
    of packet services to the GSM PLMN subscribers. Network internal interfaces for
    the support of packet services in the pan-European ISDN are defined in ETSI standards,
    which are also taken as a basis.\r\nUser-network access and network internal interfaces
    are defined to provide the packet services."
