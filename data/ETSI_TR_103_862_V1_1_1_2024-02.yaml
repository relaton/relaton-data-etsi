abstract:
- content: The TR will provide information on fixed infrastructure based indoor localization
    systems operating at well-defined locations and utilising UWB radio technology
    in the frequency band between 4,2 GHz to 4,8 GHz. The document will refer to equipment
    basically operating in accordance with EC/DEC/2019/785 and ECC/DEC(06)04, but
    it will specifically highlight transmission characteristics differentiating from
    such equipment by the need for a mean transmit power of -31dBm/MHz. The TR will
    provide solutions for mitigation measures for such transmission characteristics
    in order to protect legacy radio services from harmful interference.
