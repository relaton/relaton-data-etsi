  content: This document specifies  various Proximity Detection Methods for Pandemic
    contact tracing systems, including proximity detection mechanisms of contacts,
    anonymous identification of contacts, storage requirements for proximity data
    of contacts. Methods are clarified in sufficient technical detail such that means
    of interoperability can be readily defined in a later Work Item. Each method is
    characterized (e.g. in a table) by its degree of compatibility with the E4P requirements
    work item. The initial version of this document may be revised several times as
    additional methods are added, e.g. including methods which are gaining consensus
    in non-European countries.
