abstract:
- content: "The workTechnical Report will identify common, basic tasks and goals of
    users of mobile telecommunication terminal devices and services. The set of basic,
    common functions, through which these goals are achieved, will be described and
    analysed in  the perspective of  possible harmonisaization of user interface (UI)
    elements on the most basic level, without restricting the manufacturer's freedom
    to specific UI implementations. The work will also examine possibilities and highlight
    obstacles and limitations of such an approach.\r\nThe issues above will be addressed
    from the end user''s perspective,     in order to further simplify and enable
    basic access to mobile ICT devices and services, for all. It shall be regarded
    as a pre-study of the possibilities and key areas for further work.\r\nThe work
    will integrate, from the practical perspective, results and recommendations of
    available ETSI Human Factors Standards, Guides and Technical reports, produced
    under the eEurope initiative, for deployment. \r\nThe work will identify and recommend
    key areas for further study and guidance on device- and service, manufacturer-,
    operator- and service provider-independent implementations, covering most basic
    user actions and belonging functions.  Common, basic interactive elements and
    the familiarity achieved thereby increase the end user transference of learning
    between devices and services, without restricting the manufacturer's freedom to
    specific UI implementations. \r\n"
