    and the feasibility of a duplex universal speech and text facility which can provide
    and enhance chat facility to all users and which can be fully accessible to textphone
    users, giving them equality of access to mainstream services.\r\nThis work is
    intended to start the process towards the standardisation of future textphones
    and services which will be fully compatible with an enhanced chat service particularly
