  content: "The scope of the work item is to define architectures and specifications
    for reverse powering of a remote network node from one or multiple G.fast CPEs
    over  Point to Point (P2P) coaxial cable (coax), where there is no coexistence
    with other services over an operational Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC) network.  This
    specification specifies the reverse powering for two coax configurations with
    G.fast as described in Annex D.1 of BBF TR-285 Broadband Copper Cable Models Issue
    1 Amendment 1: G.fast with satellite TV and G.fast only.  \r\n\r\nThe relevant
    clauses to TS 101 548-1 are referenced where appropriate. Liaison with other competent
    standards bodies  is also considered within the scope of work.\r\n"
