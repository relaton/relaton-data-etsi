  content: "The present document achieves the following: optimize the end to end quality
    perceived by the user, whatever be the radio link (terminals may implement different
    radio links) - ensure compatibility across access network with VoIP, DECT terminals
    - optimize the listening and talking quality, conversational performance, use
    in noisy environment - consider the limitations in audio performance due to different
    form factors.\r\nThis revision is to provide clarifications about the applicability
    with regard to access networks, and to extend applicability to terminals with
    new types of acoustic transducers. Also, the word \"mobile\" is added to the title."
