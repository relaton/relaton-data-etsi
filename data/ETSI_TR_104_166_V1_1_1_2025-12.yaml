  content: "The Technical Report provides a guide on how to foster the development
    and maintenance of multi SDO/Fora standards-driven ONPs for standards-driven innovation,
    Multi-SDO standards harmonization, and validation of pre-deployment technology
    use cases in IMT-2020 and beyond, can be achieved.\r\nThe Technical Report might
    be used by deferent stakeholders on the following:\r\n1)\tsteps and processes
    that should be pursued by the ICT industry towards developing and maintaining
    ONPs for IMT-2020 and beyond, and the use of the testbeds federations reference
    model defined in [ITU-T Q.4068] and APIs in building ONPs;\r\n2)\tperspectives
    on how ICT industry can engage SDOs/Fora which may be able to join the ecosystem
    around establishments, funding, facilitations, exposure of ONPs to key targeted
    users, and maintenance of ONPs;\r\n3)\tthe nature and composition of ONPs required
    for certain scenarios;\r\n4)\thow to build an ONP and identify barriers to overcome;\r\n5)\thow
    to enable the federation of multiple ONPs across administrative domains and geographical
    areas;\r\n6)\t needs for funding schemes and how to leverage existing testbeds,
    while providing recommendations on how certain types of testbeds for IMT-2020
    can be transformed to conform to the reference model for federated testbeds defined
    in [ITU-T Q.4068].\r\nThe stakeholders of this Technical Report are but not limited
    to Open Source/Hardware projects, SDOs/Fora, R&D projects.\r\n"
