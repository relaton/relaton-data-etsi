abstract:
- content: "Version 1.3.1 contains further enhancements to be used in the CEN approval
    process.\r\nTS 101 206-7 version 1.1.1 is the handover version to CEN for becoming
    EN 726-7.\r\nTS 101 206-3, 4 and 7 version 1.2.1 represent an update of the documents
    handed over to CEN for becoming EN 726-3, 4, and 7. PTS has used version 1.2.1
    rather than the handover version to CEN (version 1.1.1) for producing the conformance
    testing specification for EN 726-3, 4 and 7 (prEN13343/4/5).\r\nETSI has produced
    a set of TSs which are not a copy of any CEN published EN. The TSs are complete
    and consistent documents with references among themselves. It has been made clear
    in these TSs that they are contributions to the CEN work for publication as EN (after
    re-editing the references). Once published by CEN as EN, ETSI will withdraw its
    TSs.\r\n"
