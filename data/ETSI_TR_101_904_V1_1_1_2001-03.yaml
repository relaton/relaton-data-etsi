  content: "Taking due consideration of the ongoing studies in WG-TM4 (namely, TM-04069),
    and in ERC/WGSE and ERM, in particular of compatibility issues between FDD and
    TDD systems deployed in the same geographical area using the same frequency band
    allocated by the CEPT for P-MP fixed systems, produce a Technical Report which:\r\n\r\ndescribes
    and gives background on the selection, modification or addition of technical parameters
    relevant to the usage of TDD arrangements in FWA applications,\r\nis intended
    to provide the preliminary draft of generic wording for ENs for P-MP systems using
    TDD.\r\n\r\nClose liaison with WGSE (PT SE-19), TC-ERM (WG ERM/RM) and EP DECT
    is required.\r\n \r\n"
