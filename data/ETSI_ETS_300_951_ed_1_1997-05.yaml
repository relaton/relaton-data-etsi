  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) specifies the procedure\r\ns
    used at the radio interface for normal operation, registration, eras\r\nure, activation,
    deactivation, invocation and interrogation of line id\r\nentification supplementary
    services. Provision and withdrawal of suppl\r\nementary services is an administrative
    matter between the mobile subsc\r\nriber and the service provider and cause no
    signalling on the radio in\r\nterface.\r\nIn GSM 04.10 the general aspects of
    the specification of supplementary\r\nservices at the layer 3 radio interface
    are given.\r\nGSM 04.80 specifies the formats and coding for the supplementary
    servi\r\nces.\r\nDefinitions and descriptions of supplementary services are given
    in GS\r\nM 02.04 and GSM 02.8x and 02.9x-series. GSM 02.81 is related specially\r\nto
    line identification supplementary services.\r\nTechnical realization of supplementary
    services is described in GSM 03\r\n.11 and GSM 03.8x and 03.9x-series. Technical
    specification GSM 03.81\r\nis related specially to line identification supplementary
    services.\r\nThe procedures for Call Control, Mobility Management and Radio Resourc\r\ne
    management at the layer 3 radio interface are defined in GSM 04.07 a\r\nnd GSM
    04.08.\r\nThe following supplementary services belong to the line identification\r\nsupplementary
    services and are described in this ETS:\r\n- Calling line identification presentation
    (CLIP) (section 1);\r\n - Calling line identification restriction (CLIR) (section
