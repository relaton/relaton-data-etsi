abstract:
- content: "This work item specifies the package format and descriptor format for
    MEC Applications. \r\nBased on input from ETSI ISG NFV documents, mainly ETSI
    NFV-SOL 004 and ETSI NFV-SOL 001, the work item develops the structure and format
    of a MEC Application package file and its constituents. The corresponding definitions
    in GS MEC 010-2 are used as the baseline for the new specification, as far as
    they are applicable. The package format will apply for MEC Applications deployable
    via the Mm1 reference point in both, MEC on NFV and pure \r\nMEC environments.
    It will support VM based and container based applications."
