  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) specifies measurable\r\nperformance
    requirements for signalling aspects of mobile stations. To\r\nallow implementation
    flexibility it has been chosen to specify\r\nrequirements on the whole mobile
    station rather than to specify\r\nrequirements on each \"OSI layer\". As a consequence
    the performance\r\nrequirements do not fit conveniently in specifications such
    as TS GSM\r\n04.08 (layer 3 only) or TS GSM 04.06 (layer 2 only).\r\nThe main
    aim of this ETS is to provide the justification for testing\r\nof requirements
    that are not included in other GSM specifications.\r\nWhere specific requirements
    are included in other GSM specifications\r\nthey are not duplicated here.\r\nMobile
    Stations have to perform a wide variety of functions. As a\r\nconsequence most
    performance measurements have to be made under a set\r\nof defined conditions:
    where necessary, these are included in this\r\nETS.\r\nWhere necessary certain
    assumptions are made about the interaction\r\ntimes between the mobile equipment
    and the SIM. If the (test) SIM does\r\nnot respond within the assumed time then
    appropriate allowances shall\r\nbe made.\r\nAdditionally, it is intended that
    this ETS should contain sufficient\r\nrequirements to enable some undefined network
    timers in TS GSM 04.08\r\nto be calculated.\r\n  "
