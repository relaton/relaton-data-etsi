abstract:
- content: "This draft European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) defines the\r\nOptical
    Distribution Network (ODN) which is that part of the Optical\r\nAccess Network
    (OAN) between the Optical Network Unit (ONU) and the\r\nOptical Line Terminal
    (OLT).\r\n This ETS primarily addresses the optical aspects related to the\r\ntransmission
    of the interactive services in an OAN according to the\r\nfunctional requirements
    specified in ETS 300 463.\r\n Optical aspects related to the transmission of signals
    corresponding\r\nto distributive services, which may have impact on the definition
    of\r\nthis type of ODN (e.g. the use of Optical Amplification) are also\r\ntaken
    into account, even if further studies are required in some\r\ncases.\r\n "
