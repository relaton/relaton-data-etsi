abstract:
- content: The present document gives implementation guidelines on the use of the
    electronic service guide in IP Datacast over DVB-SH system for the announcement
    of services to the terminal. These implementation guidelines apply to both "DVB-H
    ESG phase 1" defined in TS 102 471 V1.2.1 and "DVB-H ESG phase 2" defined in TS
    102 471. These two versions of the same specification mandate in particular the
    use of different ESG bootstrap structures, which particularly affects some procedures
    defined in this document.
