  content: "This document will analyse the essential data processing requirements
    in terms of trust, security and effective conformity assessment, and make recommendations
    on how PDL can be used by organisations, operations, deployment, hardware, and
    software to be trusted.\r\nThe report will reference use-cases work by other standards-developing
    organisations and material in the public domain. The essential requirements for
    the PDL technology to ensure compliance to existing regulatory aspects will also
    be analysed."
