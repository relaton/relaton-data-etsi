  content: "This document contains a recommendation for the SNMP MIB (Simple Network
    Management Protocol - Management Information Base) that addresses the relevant
    issues of the DVB Measurement Guidelines (TR 101 290).\r\nThe intention was to
    create a MIB that can be used in all test and measurement instruments which provide
    information on parameters defined in the DVB Measurement Guidelines. It can also
    be implemented in other equipment that provides besides its main functionalities
    information on parameters as defined in the DVB Measurement Guidelines, and which
    is strictly speaking not a test and measurement instrument.\r\nThis MG MIB is
    self-sufficient in the sense that it does not require any other MIB for proper
    operation. It contains all administrative information necessary for its operation,
    and it provides a description of the data base for all parameters in the TR 101
    290 that are suitable for network managment; i. e. it does not address out-of-service
    measurments or similar issues.\r\nThe lower layers of the SNMP protocol stack
    were not addressed for the purpose of this document. It was understood that there
    is a variety of existing standards which are applicable for different application
    scenarios. Neither the speed of the links in the management network is considered,
    nor are the security aspects addressed."
