  content: "The purpose of this ETSI Guide (EG), is to provide sufficient information
    and guidelines to enable the following when planning the development of an ETSI
    Standard (ES), Technical Specification (TS) or European Standard (EN):\r\n- the
    identification of an appropriate method of validation of the standard;\r\n- the
    identification of an appropriate type of test specification for products based
    on the standard.\r\nIn both cases, various criteria such as time-to-market and
    the level of confidence in the technology, are considered when determining what
    is appropriate for the standard in question. In addition, this EG gives guidance
    on the cost, effort and schedule requirements to implement the selected approach.
    This EG does not elaborate any methods for validation and testing. It provides
    references to other documents and information sources. ETR 184, ETR 304 and TCR-TR
    006 (Edition 2) contain useful additional background material.\r\nThe guidelines
    set out in this EG are, necessarily, based on the prevailing policies, methods
    and techniques for validating standards and specifying test suites.\r\n"
