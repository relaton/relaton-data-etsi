  content: "The present document specifies a collection of use cases from a variety
    of stakeholders, where the use of an Experiential Networked Intelligence (ENI)
    system can be applied to the fixed network, the mobile network, and cloud-based
    network  , to enhance the operator experience through the use of network intelligence.
    The present document is a revision of ETSI GR ENI 001 [i.1]. It identifies and
    describes additional use cases and scenarios and gives the baseline on how the
    studies in ENI can be applied as solutions of some identified use cases in accordance
    with the ENI Reference Architecture and will substantially benefit the operators
    and other stakeholders In Release 3 the present document will add additional use
    cases, including cloud based use cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
