  content: This technical specification defines a set of RSVP-like primitives and
    proxy manager using the current air interface primitives to identify RSVP messages
    and request and reserve bandwidth across the BSM.  This is particularly needed
    in the access network scenario where RSVP has the biggest chance of being deployed.  This
    TS also includes how the BSM defines the MPLS labelled paths that are discovered
    by RSVP-TE; this TS could include COPS interactions.
