  content: "This report constitutes a requirements specification for a cryptographic
    algorithm which is used to protect General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) as specified
    by GSM 02.60.\r\nThis specification is intended to provide the ETSI Security Algorithms
    Group of Experts (SAGE) with the information it requires in order to design and
    deliver a technical specification for such an algorithm.\r\nThe specification
    covers the intended use of the algorithm and use of the algorithm specification,
    technical requirements on the algorithm, requirements on the algorithm specification
    and test data, and quality assurance requirements on both the algorithm and its
    documentation. The specification also outlines the background to the production
    of this specification.\r\n"
