  content: The WI shall consider use cases of M2M applications for eHealth and the
    resulting characteristics in a TR. These use cases will identify the needed functionality
    and capabilities in a network enhanced for M2M services. Therefore, this TR will
    form the basis to derive requirements for M2M services and elements and/or procedures
    in the M2M functional architecture to support eHealth applications. It is foreseen
    to closely co-ordinate this activity with ETSI TC eHEALTH, in order to guarantee
    that the use case collection in the new TR is in line with the framework set by
    ETSI TC eHEALTH.
