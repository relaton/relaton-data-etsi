abstract:
- content: "This Work Item is intended to study  the continuation and integration
    of some HGI Smart Home activities to oneM2M, following the (PT2) HGI announcement
    of its closure by June 2016.\r\nThis interworking scenario allows for interworking
    between OCF devices and oneM2M entities purely based on the common understanding
    of aligned information models - such as the models defined in TS-0023. There is
    no limitation regarding the direction of exposure of services: Services provided
    by OCF devices (OCF servers) can be exposed to oneM2M entities or vice versa.
    The oneM2M entities do not need to be aware of any details of the OCF protocols
    or interfaces.\r\n\r\n"
