abstract:
- content: "This WI will build upon industrial use cases identified in GR ARF 002
    and develop requirements for the interoperability of AR components, systems and
    services.This deliverable is part 2 of a multipart document covering the interoperability
    requirements developed for some of the reference points specified in the ARF reference
    architecture GS ARF 003. Part 2 relates to the high level Reference Point requirements
    between the World Storage and AR Authoring functions as they are identified in
    ETSI GS ARF 003. It further defines the requirements of Reference Points  “World
    Anchors” (AR16) and “Reference Objects” (AR17).\r\n\r\n"
