abstract:
- content: The System Reference Document will provide information on the intended
    applications, the technical parameters, mitigation techniques, the relation to
    the existing spectrum regulation and additional new radio spectrum requirements
    for Wireless access systems including radio local area networks (WAS/RLANs). The
    SRdoc will contain information to support the CEPT activities resulting from Work
    Item FM_52 (covering the band 5 925 MHz to 6 425 MHz). In addition, this SRdoc
    will contain a request for considering additional frequencies up to 6 725 MHz.
    The document will  include the necessary information to support the co-operation
    between ETSI and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European
    Conference of Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT).
