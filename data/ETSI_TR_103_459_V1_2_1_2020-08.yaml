abstract:
- content: "Revision of the deliverable to further refine FRMCS functional and system
    architecture in order to deliver communication services to rail applications.\r\nThis
    will be achieved by :\r\n\r\n1.\tMapping URS Applications and use cases to a list
    of required FRMCS system functions \r\n2.\tFurther refinement of the FRMCS functional
    architecture with particular emphasis on positioning, security, addressing and
    on board architecture taking into account potential migration related topics\r\n3.\tFRMCS
    Gap Analysis and mapping of the FRMCS building blocks to 3GPP building blocks
    and possible network functions/elements.\r\n4.\tDeriving a system architecture
    including 3GPP interfaces within the FRMCS system and on the boundaries.\r\n5.\tInterfacing
    dispatcher services, recording system as well as external networks and interworking
    with legacy system \r\n"
