abstract:
- content: "Addition of part 2 to the 40 GHz MWS standard, to include essential harmonised
    parameters under the R&TTE Directive 1999/05/EC\r\n\r\nEquipment performance characteristics
    and parameters necessary to facilitate\r\ncoexistence between broadband Multimedia
    Wireless Systems (MWS) in either;\r\nadjacent frequency assignments in the same
    geographical area or\r\nco-frequency assignments in neighbouring geographical
    areas.\r\n\r\nMultimedia Wireless Systems are defined  as terrestrial multipoint
    systems which have\r\ntheir origin in telecommunication and/or broadcasting, and
    which provide fixed wireless\r\naccess direct to the end user for  multimedia
    services. These MWS systems may offer different degrees of interactivity.Therefore
    systems are anticipated that could deliver services requiring either asymmetric
    data rates, (including uni-directional distribution systems) or symmetric data
    rates between uplink and downlink. Any asymmetry between uplink and downlink may
    be fixed or dynamically variable to suit the traffic\r\ncharacteristics at any
    time.\r\n\r\nThis standard covers equipments that operate within the frequency
    band 40.5 to\r\n43.5 GHz.\r\n\r\nThe general equipment parameters will be described
    in Part 1 of the standard\r\n\r\nThe essential harmonised parameters under the
    R&TTE Directive will be specified in\r\nPart 2 of the standard."
