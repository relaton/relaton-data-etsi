  content: "When a subscriber wants to call a mobile station (MS), the network nee\r\nds
    to know the location of the called MS in order to route the call to\r\nthe appropriate
    Mobile services Switching Centre (MSC) (see GSM 03.12\r\non location registration).
    This Global System for Mobile communicatio\r\nns Technical Specification (GTS)
    describes how the routeing process ca\r\nn be performed, and considers the effect
    on the routeing process of th\r\ne capabilities of the exchanges involved.\r\nThis
    GTS assumes that the Mobile Station ISDN Number includes a specif\r\nic National
    Destination Code which identifies the Home PLMN (HPLMN) of\r\nthe called MS (referred
    to below as \"the HPLMN\"). If the numbering pl\r\nan for MSs is fully integrated
    into the fixed network numbering plan,\r\nthe method of routeing may be different.\r\nIn
    the diagrams in clause 6, the originating local exchange is shown a\r\ns being
    part of an ISDN. The same routeing principles apply if the ori\r\nginating local
    exchange is part of a PSTN.\r\nShort Messages are routed in the same way as circuit-switched
    calls; t\r\nhe SMS Gateway MSC must be able to interrogate the HLR of the MS for
    w\r\nhich the short message is intended, in order to route the short messag\r\ne
    to the visited MSC.\r\n  "
