abstract:
- content: "This Special Report will provide full details on the activities related
    to testing compliance and interoperability that will be performed in parallel
    with the building up and promotion of the Rationalised Framework. \r\nThis activity
    will firstly identify the critical ENs (which are in preparation) of the Rationalised
    Framework whose adoption and deployment would largely benefit from this type of
    events and the conformity testing tools. \r\nIt will describe the scope for testing
    interoperability, i.e., to identify the relevant aspects to be tested for each
    specification.\r\nIt will contain the scheduling that ensures first that a reasonable
    amount of tools are available at the market for being tested, and second, that
    these tests may actually impact in due time the standardisation process, allowing
    the ENs to fix any interoperability problem or ambiguity identified by the participants
    in these events.\r\nFinally, this task will also define the scheduling of conformity
    testing tools development and deployment. The task will also define when and how
    these tools have to be made available to the community. \r\n"
