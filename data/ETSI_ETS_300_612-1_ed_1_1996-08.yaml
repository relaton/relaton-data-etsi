abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) provides the conceptual\r\nand
    methodological framework for the definition of a standardized\r\napproach to the
    management of a PLMN. (This framework is elaborated in\r\nthe remainder of the
    12 series specifications) It introduces concepts\r\ndeveloped for the management
    of telecommunications networks by other\r\nstandards groups, discusses their use
    in the context of the management\r\nof a PLMN, defines a complete context for
    PLMN management information\r\nand identifies the developments of other management
    models which can\r\nbe beneficially employed in the global and integrated management
    of a\r\nPLMN.\r\nThis ETS also describes the methodology to be employed in the\r\ndefinition
    of the standardization activity and the scale of the\r\nresults which are expected
    to be achieved.\r\nPLMN management is described in terms of the objectives for
    the\r\nOperator enterprise. Relationships exist between network management\r\nfunctionality
    and functionality required to support the enterprise\r\nmodel. While the definition
    of the enterprise model is outside of the\r\nscope of this series of ETSs, an
    understanding of the requirements is\r\nnecessary so as to provide the underlying
    network management\r\nprocedures.\r\n "
