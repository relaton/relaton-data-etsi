abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 046 continues the study analysis of the feature
    of NFV support for vRAN. This edition will further profile ETSI NFV specified
    features and capabilities considering the most recent developments in normative
    and informative work performed in Release 4 and 5, including but not limited to:
    PaaS services management, automation in NFV, physical infrastructure management,
    network connectivity requirements for vRAN and certificate management.\r\nThe
    scope of the former edition (v5.1.1) is summarized hereafter: \r\nGR NFV-IFA 046
    analyses the NFV framework to determine how it can further support virtualised
    RAN (vRAN) use cases. Several key technical challenges are identified relevant
    to architectural, operational and management aspects, in case the NFV architectural
    framework is leveraged to support virtualisation of the RAN. For each technical
    challenge a detailed analysis is provided, together with a description of potential
    solutions. Potential gaps in ETSI NFV specifications are articulated and a comparison
    between the different potential solutions is also accommodated. In addition, an
    analysis of vRAN use cases from relevant specifications from other SDOs is performed,
    together with a mapping to the current NFV concepts supported by the NFV architectural
    framework. GR NFV-IFA 046 also provides recommendations for enhancements to the
    NFV architectural framework and its functionality, aiming to provide further support
    for vRAN use cases. \r\n"
