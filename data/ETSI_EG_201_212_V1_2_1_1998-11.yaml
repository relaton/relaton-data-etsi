  content: "This document applies to equipment interfaces. These interfaces within
    the equipment may be connected to TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS, or they may form
    part of the TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK infrastructure, or they may provide localized
    transfer of data. This document provides guidance on the classification of interfaces
    in accordance with the circuit types defined in EN60950 and EN41003 following
    an analysis of the telecommunication network's characteristics.\r\nExamples of
    equipment covered by the present document include, but are not limited to: \r\nfacsimile
    machines, key telephone systems, network billing equipment, PABXs, network supervisory
    equipment, telephone answering machines, network switching equipment, network
    transmission equipment, network terminating equipment, modems, telephone sets,
    and network power feeding equipment.\r\n"
