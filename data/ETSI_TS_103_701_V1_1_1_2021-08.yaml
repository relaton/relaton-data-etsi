abstract:
- content: The proposed document is to specify test scenarios for assessing  consumer
    IoT products against the provisions of EN 303 645/TS 103 645. It is to set out
    mandatory and recommended assessments, as well as guidance and examples to support
    their implementation.  The document is intended to be used by testing labs and
    certifying bodies that provide assurance on the security of relevant products,
    as well as manufacturers that wish to carry out a self-assessment.  The assurance
    schemes that this document is used in, and their outcomes, are out of scope. The
    proposed document also does not set out detailed testing protocols.  However,
    the proposed document is intended  as input to a future EU common cybersecurity
    certification scheme as proposed in the Cybersecurity Act.
