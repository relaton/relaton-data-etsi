  content: "In the course of recent years the DVB Project has very successfully de\r\nveloped
    a considerable list of specifications for Digital Video Broadc\r\nasting. As a
    matter of fact, the term \"Digital Video Broadcasting\" has\r\neven become too
    restricted, since DVB specifications can be used for\r\nbroadcasting all kinds
    of data as well as of sound, accompanied by all\r\nkinds of auxiliary information.
    Some of the specifications aim at the\r\ninstallation of bi-directional communication
    channels, for example, u\r\nsing cable installations.\r\n Due to the considerable
    complexity of the DVB environment many differe\r\nnt documents have to be taken
    into consideration when planning service\r\ns or equipment. For those who have
    been deeply involved in the develop\r\nment of the DVB solutions the list of documents
    may be comprehensible,\r\nbut at least for newcomers it would be quite natural
    to overlook some\r\nof the existing specifications, guidelines, standards etc.\r\n
    It is the purpose of this paper to present an overview of the existing\r\nDVB
    documents. This overview should be regarded as a \"cookbook\", list\r\ning all
    the ingredients for a DVB meal. It does not serve the purpose\r\nof giving a detailed
    description of the contents of the documents prod\r\nuced by the DVB Project.\r\n"
