abstract:
- content: "This ETS is the baseline specification for the provision of\r\ninteraction
    channel for CATV.\r\nIt is noted that the DVB does not intend to specify a return
    channel\r\nsolution associated to each broadcast system because the\r\ninteroperability
    of different delivery media to transport the return\r\nchannel is desirable.\r\nThe
    solutions here provided for interaction channel for CATV networks\r\nare a part
    of a wider set of alternatives to implement interactive\r\nservices for DVB broadcasting
    systems.\r\n"
