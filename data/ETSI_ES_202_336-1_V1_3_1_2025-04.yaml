abstract:
- content: "This revision will fully review the document, and includes “up-to-date”
    protocols instead of outdated ones (e.g. xml -> RESTful HTTP-based/YAML/JSON payload
    (or NetConf/YANG) etc.) \r\nThis revision will consider the impact on the structure
    of the remaining parts (2 to 11).\r\n\r\nThe WI should follow a two-stage approach:\r\na.\tprotocol-independent
    information modeling\r\nb.\tprotocol-specific data modeling e.g. in YAML/JSON\r\n\r\nBeside
    the existing PEE concept (see Part 12) an extended PEE concept will be introduced
    to integrate all data originated by infrastructure equipment (see Part 2 -11),
    which are not described by or part of the PEE concept. This will be done mainly
    together with the modernization of the “hierarchic rule” and of the description
    of “standard elements of any equipment, system or subsystem”.\r\n"
