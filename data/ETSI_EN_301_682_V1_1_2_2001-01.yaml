  content: "This work item is complementary to the one dealing with S-PCN terminal
    requirements in the 1,5/1,6 GHz band. This work item is intended to define the
    minimum requirements and technical characteristics of Network Control Facilities
    of Satellite Personal Communication Network (S-PCN) operating in the 1,5/1,6 GHz
    band. NCFs are specified in order to protect other users of the frequency spectrum
    from unacceptable interference, by ensuring that the network operator is able
    to suppress and enable the transmissions from the MESs. In particular, these facilities
    will allow certain interference situations, resulting from the emissions from
    interfering MESs, to be terminated. This standard can extensively reuse the work
    already made under ETS 300 735.\r\n"
