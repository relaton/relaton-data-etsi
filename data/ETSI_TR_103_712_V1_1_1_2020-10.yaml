abstract:
- content: To discuss and address the effectiveness of evolving new technologies and
    new structures, including phase array/low side lobe antenna, beam-forming, side
    lobe interference mitigation, coexistence with current networks, and radiated
    test to answer the challenges of the coming 5G backhaul network, in frequency
    bands above 50GHz and lower frequency bands where PMP/block license is allowed,
    such as 26/28/32/42 GHz.
