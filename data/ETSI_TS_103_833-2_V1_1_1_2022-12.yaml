  content: 'The Service centralization and continuity application server (SCC AS)
    is the entity in the IMS domain that handles the management of the access transfer
    of active sessions. The SCC AS coordinates the proper media and signalling exchange
    to the access network in which the UE is present. IMS centralized services (ICS)
    allow for centralizing IMS services regardless of whether the mode of the mobile
    network is circuit-switched (CS) or packet-switched (PS). The ICS function introduces
    a new entity in the IMS network, the service centralization and continuity application
    server (SCC AS). The SCC AS entity combines the SIP signalling and acts as a back-to-back
    user agent (B2BUA), providing an anchor point for incoming and outgoing calls.
    This conformance test specification aims to verify the SIP Protocol over the ISC
    reference point. '
