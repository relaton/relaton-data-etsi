  content: "It is proposed to revise EN 302 099 ETSI Standard (ES) to introduce requirements
    on 400V DC remote powering on power cable (voltage range, flexibility, safety,
    ) There could be also recommendation for using renewable energy at the power feeding
    centre or power cluster site. Another item is to complement  the reverse powering
    on telecom line (pair or coaxial cable) with a detection and voltage/current handshaking
    protocol between power feeding equipment and fed equipment (e.g. as done in Power
    over Ethernet). Specifications already covered in ATTM/TM6 deliverable and ongoing
    new WIs will be referred to ATTM documents (e.g. TS 101 548). The standard document
    should also be revised to cover FTTx, UBB and VoIP needs of power back-up.\r\n"
