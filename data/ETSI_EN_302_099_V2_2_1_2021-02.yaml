abstract:
- content: "It is proposed to revise EN 302 099 ETSI Standard (ES) to introduce requirements
    on 400V DC remote powering on power cable (voltage range, flexibility, safety,
    â€¦) There could be also recommendation for using renewable energy at the power
    feeding centre or power cluster site. Another item is to complement  the reverse
    powering on telecom line (pair or coaxial cable) with a detection and voltage/current
    handshaking protocol between power feeding equipment and fed equipment (e.g. as
    done in Power over Ethernet). Specifications already covered in ATTM/TM6 deliverable
    and ongoing new WIs will be referred to ATTM documents (e.g. TS 101 548). The
    standard document should also be revised to cover FTTx, UBB and VoIP needs of
    power back-up.\r\n"
