  content: "This Work Item will create a Technical Report to study enhancing oneM2M
    system to support interworking with modbus devices for horizonally extending oneM2M
    platform. The objectives of the Technical Report are as follows:\r\nInvestigate
    interworking between modbus device and the oneM2M system\r\n-Enhancements for
    oneM2M system support interworking with Modbus device, such as supporting Master-slaver
    communication method \r\n-Modbus data model is mapped to oneM2M resources \r\n-Instantiating
    Modbus data model by usage of oneM2M base ontology \r\n-Interworking procedure
    by operating oneM2M resource and reusing Gerneric Interworking (TS-0030)\r\nFurthermore,
    depending on the study result of the TR, normative works may be followed as a
    standalone TS for supporting Modubs interworking. \r\n"
