  content: The BSM traffic classes are defined to enable Quality of Service to be
    offered over the BSM. These classes are based on well known work from TIPHON and
    3GPP but include specifics that are derived from the BSM inherent architecture.
    These classes will enable to hamonize the discussion about BSM QoS, enable better
    Service Level Agreement (SLA) discussions between terrestrial and BSM operators
    and set the foundation for more quantitive performance assessment of BSMs carrying
    IP traffic.
