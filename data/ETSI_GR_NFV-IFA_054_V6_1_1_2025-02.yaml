abstract:
- content: "The work item analyzes the gaps between current NFV-MANO architecture
    as specified in ETSI GS NFV-006 (v4.4.1) and its support for new scenarios in
    NFV based telco cloud evolution elaborated by NFV whitepaper 2023 “Evolving NFV
    towards the next decade”, such as new types of virtualisation technologies, heterogenous
    infrastructure, hyper-distributed edge deployment. \r\nTo achieve architectural
    objectives such as simplification, extensibility, optimization of functionality
    layout and backward compatibility, architectural change proposals derived from
    current NFV-MANO architecture will be investigated and evaluated to resolve the
    identified gaps, if any. \r\nDesign and analysis of architectural change proposals
    will take the recommendations from activities related to architectural feature
    work (such as Release 5 FEAT23 on MANO SBA) into account to avoid potential duplicated
    or conflicting objectives of architectural changes.\r\nThe work item applies to
    all features and delivers recommendations for future normative work of NFV-MANO
    architecture adaptive to telco cloud evolution."
