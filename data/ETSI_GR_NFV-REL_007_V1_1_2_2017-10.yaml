  content: "This WI will report on how to build a resilient NFV-MANO functional block
    from the reliability/availability perspective.\r\nIt will: \r\n1) Identify critical
    NFV-MANO capabilities required to provide reliable services to the VNFs and the
    NSs. \r\n2) Map the resilience requirements, e.g., established in REL001, with
    existing NFV-MANO capabilities as listed in up to release 2 GSs.\r\n3) Study specific
    needs and constraints for the identified capabilities. \r\nThe work will  report
    on possible mechanisms that enable high-availability within the different entities
    of NFV-MANO to render the identified capabilities dependable and trustworthy."
