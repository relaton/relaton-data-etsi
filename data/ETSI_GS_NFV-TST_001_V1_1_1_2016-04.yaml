abstract:
- content: "This deliverable will develop recommendations for pre-deployment validation
    of NFV functional blocks in a lab environment.\r\nThe following aspects of lab
    testing will be addressed:\r\n1)\tFunctional validation of VNFs interaction with
    NFV functional blocks. \r\n2)\tUser and control plane performance validation.
    Including the assessment of capacity management e.g. during VNF scale-out to ensure
    that performance levels adhere to SLAs. \r\n3)\tValidation of  reliability and
    availability of VNFs, NFVI and services during workload migrations.\r\nThe deliverable
    may propose potential enhancements to the ETSI NFV architecture to better support
    testing. \r\n"
