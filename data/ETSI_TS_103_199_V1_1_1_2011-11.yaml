  content: "The deliverables want establish a define methodology for the LCA assessment
    of Telecommunication equipment and service including infrastructure.\r\nThe work
    will define rules for the functional unit selection, the system boundary selection
    and the allocation procedures, for different type of telecom services.  \r\nThe
    document will cover the assessments of telecommunication equipment and service
    and will used by manufactures and operators.\r\nThe work will be based on existing
    international available standards from ISO and IEC e.g. (IEC/EN 62075).\r\n"
