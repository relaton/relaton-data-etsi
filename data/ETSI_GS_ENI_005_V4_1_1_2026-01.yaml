  content: "The present document continues to specify the development of the ENI System
    Architecture. GS ENI 005 v4.1.1 to add:\r\n- continue the definition and specification
    of APIs and Interfaces used by the ENI System Architecture based on information
    and data models as specified in GS ENI 019 and other relevant documents,\r\n-
    continue the definition and specification of protocols used by the ENI System
    Architecture \r\n- specify the ENI cognition model in more detail\r\n- enhance
    the description and specification of the ingestion, normalisation, and output
    generation of data, information, and policies (imperative, declarative, and intent)
    in greater detail \r\n- enhance the description and specification of policy management
    used in ENI\r\n- enhance the description and specification of architectural principles
    for interacting with other groups within and outside ETSI.\r\nIn Release 4 the
    present document will specify additional details on how the Context Aware, Situational
    Aware, Knowledge Management, and Cognition Functional Blocks interact when processing
    new and changed ingested data. Finally, security information and recommendations
    will be added, focusing on zero trust.\r\n"
