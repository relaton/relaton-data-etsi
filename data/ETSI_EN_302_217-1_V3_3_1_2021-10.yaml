abstract:
- content: "To introduce the relevant material studied under MI work Items DMI-0445
    and DMI-0446. Alignment to revisions made, for the same scope, on new version
    v3.3.1 of EN 302 217-2 (see relevant new WI). Major arguments as follows:\r\n•\tIntroduction
    of CS=80 MHz in U6 and 11 GHz band and CS=220/224 MHz in bands from 18 to 42 GHz\r\n•\tRemovial
    of inconsistent RBER dynamic range for systems with higher RX threshold (wide-band,
    high frequency systems)\r\n•\tExtension of “channels-aggregation” equipment to
    more than 2 channels\r\n•\tDefinition and background for BCA (Band and Carriers
    Aggregation) systems\r\n•\tOther miscellaneous clarifications.\r\n"
