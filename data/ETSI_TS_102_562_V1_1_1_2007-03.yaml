  content: "The document will recommend the use of a channel plan for RFID devices
    in the designated band 865 - 868 MHz. The document will also recommend the use
    of synchronisation protocol techniques, which will permit channel sharing between
    multiple interrogators that are co-located. The document will be drafted to ensure
    that the contents are in accordance with EN 302 208, including the requirement
    on LBT.\r\n"
