  content: "A considerable amount of work has been conducted, mainly in the UK, to\r\ninvestigate
    the effect of wanted radio frequency transmissions from G\r\nSM MS and BTS on
    other equipment. This report aims to summarise this w\r\nork and to look at the
    implications for GSM. Since GSM EMC considerati\r\nons extend outside the GSM
    arena, it is thought essential that GSM con\r\nsiders the implications of EMC
    and produces this report.\r\n"
