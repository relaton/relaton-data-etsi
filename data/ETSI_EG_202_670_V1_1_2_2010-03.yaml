  content: "The main requirements for the work are documented in TR 102 535.  The
    work item shall address results from DTR/HF-00061 and DEG/HF-00062 that could
    not be included in EG 202 534 because they were beyond its scope.  In particular,
    case studies with target audiences identified requests for at least 75 candidate
    guidelines that could not be included in EG 202 534 because either there was no
    base data available or they concerned real-time person-to-machine communication
    rather than person-to-person communication.  Therefore work shall be performed
    to collect base data (e.g. literature review and user tests) and include real-time
    person-to-machine communication services (e.g. media quality for mobile TV streaming,
    machine avatars).\r\nThe work includes special user groups.  For example, it is
    expected to include guidelines from ongoing work on the optimisation of real-time
    text communication for people who are hearing impaired.\r\nIn summary the work
    shall include: continuing contact with intended guideline users within industry
    for their requirements and feedback; identifying the set of guidelines that should
    be developed; monitoring published research findings for inclusion as guidelines;
    performing end-user studies to create guidelines; revising EG 202 534 as a new
    Guide.\r\nThe guidelines shall be used to extend the web-based system initiated
    by DEG/HF-0062 and designed to be appropriate for key industry representatives
    (e.g. strategic planners, development engineers, customer support contacts, conference
    meeting facilitators)."
