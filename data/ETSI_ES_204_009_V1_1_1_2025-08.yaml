  content: The present document provides detailed functional, service and accessibility
    requirements from the Human Factors perspective for the implementation of and
    compliance with the European Accessibility Act which requires the provision of
    Interoperable Total Conversation (InToCo) services avoiding proprietary solutions
    and the need for user pre-registration. It details how to ensure that InToCo service,
    with voice, RTT and sign language-supportive video communication modes synchronized,
    is provided as a context-optimised service, also detailing viable fall-back options.
    Effective wireless coupling to hearing technologies, with the avoidance of interferences
    with assistive devices, and beyond, will also be addressed. The necessary background
    information and specifications containing technical parameters would be provided
    as informative annexes to the ES. The ES will additionally provide a guidance
    on how to ensure that the InToCo services for emergency communications, required
    by the EAA, are implemented in a manner that accounts for the Human Factors aspects.
    As such the ES complements other standards developed in the area, such as EN 301
    549 or EMTEL TS 101 470.
