  content: "The proposed work item is to develop a guide to the adoption of Zero Trust
    (ZT) within business in order to promote transparent and explicable security provisions
    within the business. The proposal is to describe a methodology for incorporating
    ZT into an organisation to maximise the efficiency of the resources of the organisation
    by strict application of the Kipling criteria to give the ZT-Kipling method.\r\nThe
    proposal will outline the ZT-Kipling method of system design applied to the requirements
    set out in the work of ISG ETI that maximise knowledge of the role of encryption
    applied in networked systems"
