  content: "This document provides guidance on the perceptual impact which end-to-end
    delay and end-to-end delay variation on Fax-over-IP (FoIP) and Modem-over-IP (MoIP).
    When migrating from traditional TDM based network to the NGN, one important aspect
    is the continued availability of the existing services to the user without creating
    a discontinuity in the end-to-end QoS as perceived by the user; this document
    provides for a variety of network and terminal settings threshold objectives for
    delay and delay variation which are based on a series of objective investigations
    in a lab environment. In addition the work and results of STF 392 will be integrated.\r\n"
