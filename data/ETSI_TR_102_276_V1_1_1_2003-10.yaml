- content: "Determination of QoS that are of concern to users with the follwoing points
    in mind:\r\na) the uniquely identifiable groups of customers who have specific
    requirements\r\nb) the order of priority of the performance criteria for each
    of the main groups\r\nc) the preferred performance values for parameters which
    qualify for such quantification?\r\nd) if there are any other criteria in addition
    to those identified that are of concern to the users\r\nThe QoS criteria will
    be obtained by interviewing users, regulators and manufacturers in 7 countries
    in Europe thus ensuring with a certain amount of confidence that these represent
    a European view with customer validation."
