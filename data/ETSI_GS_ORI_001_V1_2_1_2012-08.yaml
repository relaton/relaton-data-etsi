  content: "Addition of C&M requirements applicable to the first release (Release
    1) of the Open Radio equipment Interface (ORI).\r\nRelease 1 focuses on the support
    of the following 3GPP radio access technologies: \r\n\tUTRA-FDD, \r\n\tE-UTRA-FDD,\r\n\tE-UTRA-TDD.\r\n\r\n(Note):
    The requirements are the same as those previously included in the C&M functionality
    section of 0001 specification, but were removed in ORI#5 to allow an early publication
    of DGS/ORI-0001 and DGS/ORI-0002.\r\n"
