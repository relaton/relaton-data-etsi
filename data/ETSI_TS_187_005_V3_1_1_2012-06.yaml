abstract:
- content: "Update of TS 187 005 to address extensions to the NGN feature set. This
    to include the NGN specific mapping of the dynamic triggering capability specified
    in TC LI for NGN equipment. The specification shall include a mapping to the handover
    capabilities defined in TC LI (in some cases there may not be a mapping of NGN
    capability to handover capability but if this is the case TISPAN shall work with
    TC LI to resolve and correct the problem).\r\nThis will be carried out in close
    collaboration with TC LI and request for joint approval."
