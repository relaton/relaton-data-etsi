abstract:
- content: This work item will identify and define relevant use cases with corresponding
    general key-performance-indicators (KPIs), deployment scenarios wherein RIS technology
    will play a role and potential requirements for each identified use case with
    the aim of promoting interoperability with existing and upcoming wireless technologies
    and networks. Aspects around system/link performance, spectrum, co-existence,
    and security will be analyzed as main content of the document. The deliverable
    for this work item will be an ETSI Group Report (GR), containing only informative
    elements, to be approved for publication by the ETSI ISG RIS.
