  content: "This Technical specification (TS) specifies the technical characteristics
    (electrical interface requirements) to be provided by Terminal Equipment (TE)
    to be connected to a 2-wire analogue interface of the PSTN at which network addressing
    is intended to be performed by means of loop disconnect signalling, insofar as
    they are particular to the loop disconnect signalling function. Reference document:
    prTBR21.\r\n"
