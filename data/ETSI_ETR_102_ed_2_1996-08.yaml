abstract:
- content: "This Technical Report contains technical performance objectives that\r\nshould
    be met for the fixed infrastructure of GSM PLMNs. Concerning\r\ntransmission delay
    for the PLMN in section 4, the requirements should\r\nalso be met by GSM Mobile
    Stations.\r\nThese performance design objectives are applicable to all\r\nimplementations
    at all points in the growth cycle up to the maximum\r\nsize. These reference loads
    and performance objectives may be used by\r\nmanufacturers in designing GSM PLMNs
    and by Administrations or RPOAs\r\nin evaluating a specific design or for comparing
    different designs for\r\npotential use in the Administration s or RPOA s intended\r\nimplementation.\r\n "
