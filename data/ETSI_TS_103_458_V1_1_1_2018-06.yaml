abstract:
- content: "This WI specifies an application of ABE to implement ABAC for specific
    environments where access to data has to be given to multiple parties and under
    different conditions.\r\nThe work item will describe the ABE encryption and decryption
    mechanisms, the boundary conditions relating to the underlying cryptography, the
    key distribution protocols and any related architectural aspect.\r\nThree main
    use cases will be addressed: Cloud, Mobile, IoT.\r\nCloud: At least one use case
    from ISO 19944. The use case will adopt policy rule syntax from 19944, and ISO
    definition and standard architecture for Cloud computing from ISO/IEC 17788/9.
    Under the liaison with ISO/IEC SC38, it is proposed that this activity could be
    performed in connection and with the advisory of ISO 19944 project for impact
    evaluation.\r\nMobile: At least one use cases from the Smarter 3GPP document TR22.891
    related to the scenario of user access from less trusted networks. The objective
    is to provide user identity protection preventivg disclousure to unauthorized
    entity.\r\nIoT: At least two use cases covering IoT or edge scenarios where data
    access mechanisms are actioned either in the network or on the device. The objective
    is to retain flexibility w.r.t. reuse of the work by other standardisation bodies,
    e.g. oneM2M."
