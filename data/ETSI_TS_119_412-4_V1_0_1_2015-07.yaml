  content: "The present document specifies a certificate profile for web site certificates
    that are issued to organisations and that are accessed by the TLS protocol.\r\nThe
    profile defined in the present document builds on the CAB Baseline requirements
    and Extended validation guidelines.  \r\nThe present document focuses on requirements
    on certificate content. Requirements on decoding and processing rules are limited
    to aspects required to process certificate content defined in the present document.
    Further processing requirements are only specified for cases where it adds information
    that is necessary for the sake of interoperability. "
