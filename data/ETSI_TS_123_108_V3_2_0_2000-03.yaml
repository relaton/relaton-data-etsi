abstract:
- content: "This TS specifies the procedures used at the radio interface (Reference
    Point Um, see GSM 04.02) for Call Control (CC), Mobility Management (MM), and
    Session Management (SM).\r\nWhen the notations for \"further study\" or \"FS\"
    or \"FFS\" are present in this TS they mean that the indicated text is not a normative
    portion of this standard.\r\nThese procedures are defined in terms of messages
    exchanged over the control channels of the radio interface. The control channels
    are described in GSM 04.03.\r\nThe structured functions and procedures of this
    protocol and the relationship with other layers and entities are described in
    general terms in TS 24.007."
