abstract:
- content: 'The present document discusses existing attestation technologies and practices,
    as applicable to NFV systems, addressing: • The identification and definition
    of levels of assurance • The assumed capabilities from the NFVI (e.g. TPM, HSM,
    etc.) • Operational procedures • A gap analysis of current (established or newly
    proposed) attestation technologies • Recommendations for follow-on PoCs to demonstrate
    feasibility of the attestation procedures Given the current status of attestation
    technologies and standards, the present document is applicable to hypervisor-based
    NFV deployments only, with the exception of some of the perspectives analysed
    in clause 8. The proposed work item for revision is to update SEC007 on the term
    TPM with generic descriptions, including using NFV-SEC’s own term HBRT, or adding
    equivalent hardware implementations, just like IETF draft-ietf-rats-tpm-based-network-device-attest-14
    says in the abstract.'
