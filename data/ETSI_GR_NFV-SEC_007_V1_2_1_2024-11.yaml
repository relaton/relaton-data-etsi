  content: 'The present document discusses existing attestation technologies and practices,
    as applicable to NFV systems, addressing:  The identification and definition of
    levels of assurance  The assumed capabilities from the NFVI (e.g. TPM, HSM, etc.)  Operational
    procedures  A gap analysis of current (established or newly proposed) attestation
    technologies  Recommendations for follow-on PoCs to demonstrate feasibility of
    the attestation procedures Given the current status of attestation technologies
    and standards, the present document is applicable to hypervisor-based NFV deployments
    only, with the exception of some of the perspectives analysed in clause 8. The
    proposed work item for revision is to update SEC007 on the term TPM with generic
    descriptions, including using NFV-SECs own term HBRT, or adding equivalent hardware
    implementations, just like IETF draft-ietf-rats-tpm-based-network-device-attest-14
    says in the abstract.'
