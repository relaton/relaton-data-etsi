  content: "This work item is intended to provide an overview of the impact of quantum
    computing on the security proofs of several cryptographic protocols. It discusses
    which security proofs are invalidated, or otherwise affected, in the presence
    of a large-scale quantum-capable attacker, and discusses for each affected system
    whether \r\na)\tan alternative proof has been found that does provide security
    against quantum attacks, but possibly with a reduced security level, \r\nb)\tno
    alternative proof has been found, but security is expected to still hold,\r\nc)\tthe
    cryptographic system is expected to be broken by quantum attacks, in a way which
    is not captured by the classical security proof, although no concrete quantum
    attack exists yet, or\r\nd)\ta concrete quantum attack that breaks security, in
    a way which is not captured by the classical proof, is available.\r\nFurthermore,
    the practical impact of these considerations is presented.\r\nExamples of cryptographic
    security proofs that are affected by quantum computing are proofs written with
    the Random-Oracle methodology (thus impacting the popular Fiat-Shamir and Fujisaki-Okamoto
    transforms), the rewinding technique for zero-knowledge proof systems, and the
    binding property of commitment schemes.\r\nA starting point for this work item
    is provided by the e-print paper Post-Quantum Cryptography: Computational-Hardness
    Assumptions and Beyond (https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/571)"
