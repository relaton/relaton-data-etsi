  content: "This work item focuses on defining solutions that allow deployment of
    MEC in an NFV environment.\r\n\r\nThe work will be a study with the intent to
    describe such solutions, document their architectural impacts, and conclude on
    the necessary normative work to enable one or more selected solutions, including
    potential changes to the MEC architecture.\r\n\r\nIt will also decide where this
    normative work needs to be done, e.g. MEC Architecture GS, MEC interfaces GSs,
    in a new normative MEC GS or in specifications of other SDOs, as applicable.\r\n\r\nIf
    applicable, ETSI ISG MEC will initiate collaboration with ETSI ISG NFV and potentially
    other SDOs, to perform the required modifications to their respective specifications.\r\n\r\nThe
    document produced will be an informative GS."
