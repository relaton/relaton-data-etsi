abstract:
- content: The current structure of TS 187 001 is not fully aligned to that of the
    TVRA and is hard to identify the suite of services being offered to NGN users.
    It is proposed to restructure the document and to provide verification of each
    requirement to the TVRA analysis and to the sub-system that the requirements apply
    to.
