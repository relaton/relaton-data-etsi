    order to identify missing security requirement, in particular identify the boundary
    of an RRS Radio Application with regard to the security functions present in existing
    RAT.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the role of the core network with regard to RRS should
    be identified for any relevant RAT, in particular whether the core network can
    trigger the Reconfigurable Equipment to reconfigure via a push mechanism."
