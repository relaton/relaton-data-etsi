  content: "Identification of use cases for visually impaired people for e-access
    to ICT products and services but also use cases to allow users to interact with
    machines or equipment (e.g. users terminal, user interface) via dedicated devices
    (M2M communications) in order to define appropriate protocols (NFC or similar)
    \r\nThe intention is not to define technical solutions but to forward the requirements
    to the appropriate TBs\r\n"
