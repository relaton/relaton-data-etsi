abstract:
- content: "•The scope of this work is the definition of an architecture and an Application
    Programming Interface (API) for supporting A/B forensic watermarking for Over-The-Top
    (OTT) on content that is delivered in an Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) format. To the
    possible extend, the proposed solutions do not make assumptions on the ABR technology
    that is being used, it can be for example, DASH or HLS. A/B forensic watermarking
    means that at least two watermarked versions of content (variant A and variant
    B) are delivered up to a CDN edge server from the encoder. The edge server is
    responsible for delivering either the A or B variant of every segment to the device.\r\n•\tWhile
    digital watermarking can be used for different use cases, this work will focus
    on forensic use cases. In this context, it is used to define the origin of content
    leakage. The watermarking technology modifies media content in a robust and invisible
    way in order to encode a unique identifier, e.g., a unique session ID. The embedded
    watermark provides means to identify where the media content, that has been redistributed
    without authorization, is coming from. In other words, the watermark is used to
    forensically trace the origin of content leakage.\r\n•This work is carried out
    under the PAS agreement between ETSI and DASH-IF\r\n"
