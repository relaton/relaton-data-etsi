  content: Update of the definition of return channels and corresponding protocols
    enabling interactive services in mobile interactive broadcast systems. The work
    concerns satellite broadcast systems operating in the 2 GHz MSS S-band, typically
    applying DVB-SH. All channels use the 2 GHz MSS band. This part defines the system
    signalling and will be updated mainly based on the experimental results obtained
    in the EC co-funded project SafeTRIP.
