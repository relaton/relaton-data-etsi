abstract:
- content: "The work item will develop a System Reference Document (SRDoc) for wideband
    SRDs with advanced spectrum sharing capability operating in the UHF 870-876 MHz
    and 915-921 MHz frequency bands.\r\nThe objective of this work item is to seek
    \ access to the 870-876 MHz and 915-921 MHz frequency bands for wideband SRD technologies,
    which enable a wide range of IoT (Internet of Things) and M2M applications.\r\nThe
    SRDoc will cover:\r\n•\tMarket information \r\n•\tTechnical characteristics and
    parameters for wideband SRDs, where if required 802.11ah technology is considered
    as an example for the deployment of wideband SRDs\r\n•\tRadio frequency spectrum
    request and justifications for increasing the maximum transmission bandwidth limit
    and relaxing the duty cycle limits (e.g. 1%)  for wideband SRDs where advanced
    spectrum sharing techniques like LBT (CSMA), AFA are additionally employed\r\nBackground:\r\nThe
    current regulatory rules being considered for SRD operations in the 870-876MHz
    and 915-921MHz are based on previously defined SRD technical characteristics (e.g.
    TR102 649-2). Presently, the maximum transmission bandwidth is limited to 600kHz.
    \r\nA Liaison Statement from CEPT WG FM (78th Meeting in October 2013) to ETSI
    TC ERM, suggested that a new SRDoc should be created:\r\n-\t“A new request has
    been received during the public consultation of ECC Report 200 from the Wifi-alliance
    and Qualcomm for UHF SRD applications (870-876/ 915-921 MHz) for air interfaces
    with wider bandwidth (e.g. 1 MHz) and using a frequency channel selection mechanism
    for accessing the spectrum. This request has been passed over to SRD/MG which
    also received a presentation from Qualcomm in August 2013. This request was not
    included in the original five ETSI System Reference Documents for the UHF SRD
    activities and consequently, is not covered by the studies in ECC Report 200.
    WGFM sees a benefit in a precise description of such a request, for transparency
    reasons and in light of the five original System Reference Document requests,
    that ERM considers the creation of an ETSI System Reference Document for the purpose
    of addressing air interfaces as said above, which could then be studied in the
    future.”\r\nAn example for wideband SRDs with advanced spectrum sharing capability
    is the IEEE 802.11ah standard, which  is currently being developed. Many use cases
    of this technology overlaps with those of SRDs, like home and house automation,
    access control, machine-to-machine, telemetry and telecommand, etc. The addition
    of wider bandwidth SRDs for use in the 870-876 MHz and 915-921 MHz bands across
    CEPT countries will potentially enable many new Internet of Things (IoT) and similar
    SRD-oriented applications through higher achievable data rates, natural IP support,
    as well as many power and capacity efficient features."
