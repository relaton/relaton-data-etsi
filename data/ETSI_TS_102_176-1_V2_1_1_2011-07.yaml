abstract:
- content: Since national legislation of some EU Member States rely on the TS 102176-1
    on parameters of Algorithms needs to revise regularly due to cryptoanalysis progress
    and the introduction of new algorithms. The use of a machine-processable parameter
    description, as e.g. the current Internet Draft “Data Structure for the Security
    Suitability of Cryptographic Algorithms (DSSC)” published by the IETF LTANS group,
    a standard format which allow unique description of suitable parameters related
    to concrete period of time should be considered. The maintenance policy of cryptographic
    algorithms on the long term of signature algorithms is not formalized yet, as
    it is for the signature policy today. The revised TS will address this concern
    too.
