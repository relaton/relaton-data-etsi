abstract:
- content: "Identify TISPAN mobility/continuity/portability scenarios and the impact
    of mobility control on the TISPAN architecture (including RACS and NASS) for supporting
    session continuity and handover between TISPAN access networks and/or between
    a TISPAN access network and other access networks (e.g. 3GPP IP-CANs)\r\nThis
    work requires coordination with and consideration of work at external SDOs such
    as 3GPP, and ITU, and Fora such as the WiMAX Forum.\r\nCoordination with other
    Stage I, II and III TISPAN documents will be required."
