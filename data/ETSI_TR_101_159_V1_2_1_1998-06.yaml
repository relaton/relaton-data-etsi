  content: "This document is a guide how to implement and test DECT systems operating
    at frequencies outside the frequency-bands described in ETS 300 175-2 and TBR
    6. The need to have this arises if DECT equipment is to be adapted to national
    requirements of countries which do not allow to use the basic 1 880 to 1 900 MHz
    DECT frequency band.\r\nThis revision adds a new Annex A and deletes Annexes B
    and C."
