  content: "This WI proposes a study of how one designs processing components to achieve
    scalabiity, efficiency, and reliability in NFV environments. To meet the low-latency
    and high-availability requirements, this will require new techniques and abstractions
    for managing shared processing state. The hope is to identify application-independent
    techniques that can be applied generally, rather than have each VNF use its own
    idiosyncratic method for meeting these goals.   \r\n\r\nAlthough an individual
    VNF could manage its own scale and replication, it is envisioned that an end-to-end
    service composed of many disparate VNFs would require a a single coherent manager,
    such as an orchestrator that would manage the scale and capacity of the VNFs.
    \  \r\n\r\nTo illustrate our intentions, consider how one might achieve scalable
    reliability when there is no state shared between flows and the failure of a small
    number of flows is acceptable. Todays IT/Cloud Data Centers exhibit very high
    availability levels by limiting the amount of unique state in a single element
    and creating a virtual network function from a number of small replicated components
    whose functional capacity  can be scaled in and out by adjusting the running number
    of components. Reliability and availability for these type of VNFs is provided
    by a number of small replicated components. When an individual component fails,
    little state is lost and the overall VNF experiences minimal change in functional
    capacity. Capacity failures can be recovered by instantiating additional components.
    Adjustments to load balancing across the active instances may be required.  \r\n\r\nWe
    offer this as an initial example of how scalable reliability might be achieved.
    We anticipate the resulting document will consider a wide variety of use cases,
    involving differing levels of shared state and different reliability requirements,
    and these will each require their own application-independent way of how to manage
    state, react to failures, and respond to increased load.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly,
    the deliverable from this proposed WID is an Informative Report. The intent is
    to provide guidance on Best Practices for scale out system architectures for the
    management of reliability.  \r\n\r\nExternal dependencies of this work item are:
