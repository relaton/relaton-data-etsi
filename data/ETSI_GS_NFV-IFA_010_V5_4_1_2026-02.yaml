abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 010 continues the development of the specification
    as part of the NFV Release 5. This edition will implement approved change requests
    which are missing in the published version 5.3.1. It will also consider updates
    related to time synchronization and partial packaging according to the recommendations
    in ETSI GR NFV-IFA046. The scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:
    \r\n\r\nNFV-IFA 010 specifies functional requirements for NFV management and orchestration,
    and general guidelines and requirements for NFV management and orchestration interface
    design. The scope of NFV-IFA 010 does not cover the functional requirements on
    interfaces."
