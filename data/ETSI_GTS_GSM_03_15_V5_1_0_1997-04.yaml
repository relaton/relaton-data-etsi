abstract:
- content: "The network feature Operator Determined Barring allows a network\r\noperator
    or service provider to regulate access by subscribers to GSM\r\nservices, by the
    barring of certain categories of incoming or outgoing\r\ntraffic or of roaming.
    Operator Determined Barring applies to all\r\nbearer services and teleservices
    except the Emergency Call\r\nteleservice; the teleservice Short Message Point-to-Point
    is therefore\r\nsubject to Operator Determined Barring in the same way as\r\ncircuit-switched
    calls.\r\nThe application of specific categories of Operator Determined Barring\r\nto
    a subscription is controlled by the network operator or service\r\nprovider, using
    administrative interaction at the HLR; this interface\r\nis not standardised.\r\n"
