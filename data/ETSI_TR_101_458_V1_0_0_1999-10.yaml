  content: "Version 1.0.0 of this TR will be circulated to other ETSI TBs and outside
    ETSI for comment.\r\n________\r\nStandardisation work beyond the Initial Phase
    of UMTS (the initial phase of UMTS is covered by the Third Generation Partnership
    Project - 3GPP) will initially focus on \"Services\" and Systems Architecture\".
    \r\nExamples of work to be studied in this report include the vision for UMTS
    based on IP, ATM, IP over ATM, etc...; Virtual Home Environment (VHE), Virtual
    Network Operators (VNO)... using as a basis U-99031. What should be the role of
    EP UMTS in defining the key characteristics for UMTS Phases 2 / 3? Should any
    of the above tasks be done elsewhere in ETSI or should they all be performed /
    managed within EP UMTS? -\r\n------------ \r\n1.What do we mean by a \"Broader
    approach to UMTS\"? \r\n2.What are the benefits for ETSI of complementing the
    GSM based approach to UMTS being adopted in 3GPP by the development of alternative
    and longer term approaches ? \r\n3.What are the market drivers for alternative
    approaches to UMTS? \r\n4.What is needed for UMTS that will not be provided in
    the Initial phase of UMTS being developed in 3GPP? \r\n- (a) Radio and Transmission
    Aspects. \r\n- (b) Network and Terminal Aspects. \r\n5.What impact does the recent
    Trans Atlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) have on ETSI's work for UMTS? - How should
    EP UMTS relate to the Operators Harmonization Group (OHG)? \r\n6.How is ETSI going
    to respond to 3GPP2 and other members proposed for the IMT-2000 family in the
    ITU?\r\n - (a) ITU Aspects.\r\n - (b) 3GPP / 3GPP2 Aspects. \r\n7.When will alternate
    technologies to the transport of voice and data over ATM (AAL2/AAL5) be available
    for UMTS ? - What will these technologies be? \r\n8.What are the key characteristics
    for UMTS Phases 2/3 that will not be provided in the Initial Phase of UMTS in
    3GPP?\r\n _______________ \r\nSupporting organisations (BT, Alcatel, France Telecom,
    DTI, Nortel, Motorola, ...)"
