  content: "The present document defines security provisions for Smart Voice-Controlled
    Devices extending from the provisions for consumer IoT devices defined in ETSI
    EN 303 645 [1].\r\nIn terms of security concerns, Smart Voice-Controlled Device
    has a different focus than other generic IoT devices (e.g., distributed sensors,
    smart appliances, etc.). For example, Smart Voice-Controlled Devices mainly interact
    with users through voice assistants that can understand users' voice commands
    and assist users to control other devices in the IoT network. This feature actually
    expands the attack surface of Smart Voice-Controlled Devices. In addition, Smart
    Voice-Controlled Devices usually collect the user's voice and train a model uniquely
    suitable for the current user to provide personalized service. Therefore, Smart
    Voice-Controlled Devices-related privacy protection issues are particularly prominent.
    This vertical will focus on addressing the unique security issues of Smart Voice-Controlled
    Devices.\r\nNOTE 1: Smart Voice-Controlled Devices in the context of this standard
    refers specifically to Smart Voice-Controlled Devices used in consumer environments,
    not those used in industrial environments. Smart Voice-Controlled Devices for
    industrial purpose is not in the scope of this document.\r\n"
