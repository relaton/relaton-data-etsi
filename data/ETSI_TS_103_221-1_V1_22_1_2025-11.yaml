abstract:
- content: "The internal network interface covers wide area connections between LI
    systems and (depending on the network) lots of network elements from different
    vendors. Nearly every network element has its own interface with different transport
    protocols, authentication (if any), encryption (if any), commands etc. This makes
    every new connection highly complicated and costly.\r\nThe interfaces between
    Administration and Mediation Functions are usually proprietary and internally
    within a product for LI and therefore need not be compatible between products
    of different vendors.\r\n\r\nTraditionally X1 and HI1 interfaces have not been
    standardized. Given the experience of standardization in HI2 and HI3 industry
    has received benefits from this by way of interoperability, security and cost
    reduction.\r\n\r\nThe present document does not intend to force compatibility
    on legacy equipment although should that be possible it will be welcomed. An inability
    by the LEMF to support this proposed standard should not allow a fall back to
    a less secure protocol. The initial focus is on newer IP related systems (but
    not limited to IP). However there is no intention to exclude circuit switch or
    other elements from using this output.\r\n\r\nWith a view to the future, as network
    and services become virtualized, the present documentI supports newer implementations
    by ensuring a standard interface is available to the provisioning equipment or
    service.\r\n\r\nThe ADMF (provisioning system) translates HI1 messages to X1 and
    vice versa. It is effectively a proxy between the LEA/LEMF and the network operator.
    This allows insulation for the CSP to manage their network as they see fit without
    untoward impact on the LEMF, and vice versa. It also allows for enhanced security
    management. Maintaining this concept is key to this work item.\r\nIt is intended
    to start work with the X1 interface and follow with interfaces X3 and X2.\r\n\r\nScope\r\n1.Alignment
