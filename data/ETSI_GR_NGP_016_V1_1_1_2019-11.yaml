abstract:
- content: The work item will describe a framework that enables a Layer 3 deterministic
    service over large-scale networks. Four functional components to construct the
    whole framework are (1) User-Network Interface; (2) Resource Reservation Signalling;
    (3) Deterministic Forwarding Mechanisms and (4) OAM toolset. No specific technical
    solution will be recommended in this work item. However, some example mechanisms
    will be described in order to prove the effectiveness of the framework.
