abstract:
- content: "This GSM Technical Specification describes the requirements (at a stage
    0 level) of the Fraud Information Gathering System (FIGS). FIGS provides the means
    for the HPLMN to monitor a defined set of subscriber activities.\r\nThe aim is
    to enable service providers/network operators to use FIGS, and service limitation
    controls such as ODB and IST, to limit their financial exposure to large unpaid
    bills produced on subscriber accounts whilst the subscriber is roaming outside
    their HPLMN. HPLMNs may also choose to send information across the Y-interface
    on subscriber activities whilst their subscribers are within the HPLMN.\r\n"
