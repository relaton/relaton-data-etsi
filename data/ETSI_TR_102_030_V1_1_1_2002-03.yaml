  content: "Draft: This task is to provide recommendations for the support of a relying
    party to verify that the issuer of a received certificate can be trusted at the
    time of the transaction. \r\n\r\nCurrent EESSI work will ensure that the party
    relying on a certificate (e.g. the recipient of a signed contract or payment order)
    receives sufficient information to control the validity of the certificate. There
    are also standards supporting uniform ways to carry out such control.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it is far more difficult to check whether the issuing CSP is OK at the time of
    the actual transaction: the CSP may have gone out of business or failed to pass
    the latest audit, etc. This type of information has to be provided by a third
    party, independent of the signer of the transaction or the issuer of the certificate
    in question. The importance of this information is particularly high for cross-domain
    and cross-border, international transactions. Currently proposed national schemes
    for the provision of status information about CSPs are not being harmonized, neither
    are the protocols and formats used for retrieving such information by the relying
    party. Such a procedure needs to interface to the technical as well as to the
    accreditation framework, which may be the reason why the problem has not been
    addressed yet in a consistent and harmonised way. The proposed work item should
    address both aspects and identify the necessary procedural and technical features."
