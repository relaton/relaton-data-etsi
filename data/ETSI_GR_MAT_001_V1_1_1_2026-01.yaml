abstract:
- content: "Various Multiple Access Techniques (MAT) have been specified in 3GPP for
    the downlink LTE and NR physical layer radio interfaces. \r\n-\t3G based on CDMA,
    while 4G LTE and 5G NR is based on OFDMA;\r\n-\tMU-MIMO transmissions in 4G and
    5G combining OFDMA with SDMA for increased spectral efficiency; and \r\n-\t4G
    LTE also specifying Multi-User Superposition Transmission (MUST).\r\n\r\nAlso
    in there is significant academic literature for different MAT under the name of
    NOMA, RSMA. However, due to different terminology and different frameworks in
    existing works, it is often difficult to understand the key differences between
    specified MAT and new MAT. \r\n\r\nThis work item will study the following aspects
    for candidate MATs (e.g. OMA, SDMA, NOMA and RSMA):\r\n-\tDefinition of baseline
    architectures and common terminology for candidate MATs;\r\n-\tClassification
    of candidate MAT based on their main characteristics; and\r\n-\tGap analysis of
    candidate MAT with features specified in 3GPP such as MUST (TR 36.859 and RP-160680)
    and NR demodulation performance evolution (TR 38.878).\r\n\r\nThe above studies
    will be done for the following two downlink delivery modes:\r\n-\tunicast-only
    delivery\r\n-\tjoint broadcast/multicast and unicast delivery.\r\n\r\nAdditional
    assumptions for this work item can be found in MAT(25)01_013r1."
