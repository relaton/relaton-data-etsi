  content: This Technical Report contains harmonised definitions and measurement methods
    for a range of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters that relate to network-network
    interconnection. The purpose of these parameters is to define objective and comparable
    measures of the QoS delivered at points of interconnection. The establishment
    of target values for QoS is beyond the scope of this report. The Quality of Service
    parameters apply only to the interconnection of digital circuit switched and leased
    line connections provided over SDH or PDH transmission technologies. The report
    may be revised to cover IP based technologies at a future date. The Quality of
    Service parameters apply for any services provided over digital circuit switched
    and leased line connections, including:-Fixed to fixed, including services to
    geographic and non-geographic numbers; Fixed to mobile; Mobile to mobile; All
    forms of services with special user tariff arrangements such as freephone, shared
    cost and premium rate.
