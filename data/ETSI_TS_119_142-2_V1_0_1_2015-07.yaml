abstract:
- content: "The present document defines multiple profiles for PAdES digital signatures.
    On set of profiles extends the scope of the profile in PAdES part 1, while keeping
    some features that enhance interoperability of PAdES signatures. These profiles
    in the present document provide equivalent requirements to profiles found in ETSI
    TS 102 778.\r\nThe present document also contains a profile for the use of PDF
    signatures, as described in ISO 32000-1 and based on CMS digital signatures, that
    enables greater interoperability for PDF signatures by providing additional restrictions
    beyond those of ISO 32000-1.\r\nThe present document does not repeat the base
    requirements of the referenced standards, but instead aims to maximize interoperability
    of CMS-based digital signatures in various business areas. \r\n"
