  content: "The purpose of this work item is to define what would be considered an
    AI threat and how it might differ from threats to traditional systems. The WI
    defines a common terminology for AI (aligned to CEN/ISO). The starting point that
    offers the rationale for this work is that currently, there is no common understanding
    of what constitutes an attack on AI and how it might be created, hosted and propagated.\r\nThe
    AI Threat Ontology deliverable will seek to align terminology across the different
    stakeholders and multiple industries. This document will define what is meant
    by these terms in the context of cyber and physical security and with an accompanying
    narrative that should be readily accessible by both experts and less informed
    audiences across multiple industries. Note that this threat ontology will address
    AI as a system, an adversarial attacker, and a system defender."
