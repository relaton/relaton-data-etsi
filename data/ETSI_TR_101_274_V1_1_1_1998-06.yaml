abstract:
- content: In this report an overview of different access techniques TDMA, DS-CDMA,
    FDMA and FH-CDMA is made, in order to evaluate some parameters such as occupied
    band, capacity, minimum power at the receiver in threshold conditions. Although
    it is possible for P-MP systems to support limited mobility, this document will
    only consider fixed radio access.
