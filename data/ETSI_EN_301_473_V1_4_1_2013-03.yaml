abstract:
- content: Following the WRC-03 decision to allocate to MSS the bands 1518-1525 MHz
    (downlink) and 1668-1675 MHz (uplink) and the conclusions of WRC-07, this work
    item is to propose the necessary changes for AESs that can operate in the additional
    1668 MHz to 1675 MHz frequency band made available by the WRC-03/07 decisions.  Additional
    revisions to the standard are also proposed to align this standard with the recent
    changes to inband emissions in EN 301 681.
