  content: "To realize an overview of the relevant pseudonym change strategies and
    solutions suitable for C-ITS (pseudonymous authentication based on PKI). \r\nTo
    provide a comparison of the efficiency and the estimated performances of different
    pseudonym change strategies and identify relevant strategies to support various
    ITS-S profiles. \r\nThe change rate of ITS-S credentials is a crucial parameter
    for protection of privacy. However these strategies may have different impacts
    on the level of privacy, on communication overhead, storage and computation, as
    well as on costs. As pseudonym ID changes must be consistent across layers, pseudonym
    changes also have impact on C-ITS protocol stack performances (i.e. all stack
    layers has to change there IDs).\r\nTo make recommendations for further specifications
    for existing standards revision or new standard development."
