abstract:
- content: The present document examines LI and LD network function security with
    a focus on virtualisation. It considers a broad definition of virtualisation i.e.
    including but not restricted to Network Functions Virtualisation. It focuses on
    threats and risks, provides applicable recommendations (although these are not
    meant to be exhaustive), and identifies areas where other standards present recommendations
    which are relevant to the threats and risks identified. The present document considers
    reuse of existing standards where applicable. It also considers a mixed deployment
    of physical and virtualised LI and LD implementations. It is restricted to LI
    and LD considerations only and does not look at wider considerations. Specifically,
    broader national security concerns are out of scope of the present document.
