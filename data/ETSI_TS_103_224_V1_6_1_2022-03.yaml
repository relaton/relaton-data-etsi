abstract:
- content: "A sound field reproduction technique is described allowing the physical
    reproduction of real, prerecorded sound fields in a laboratory type environment.
    In contrast to other methodologies the technique is targeted to reproduce the
    spectral, temporal and spatial characteristics of sound fields. The method is
    intended to be used for testing modern type of terminals including advanced signal
    processing techniques including multi-microphone and array technologies. A background
    noise database is supplied with the standard taking into account types of background
    noise included in EG 202 396-1.\r\nThe revision is to extend the equalization
    procedure described in clause 6.2 of the deliverable for applications that require
    accurate reproduction of low-frequency energy.\r\nTo achieve this, the lower frequency
    limit of the sub-band processing during the equalization procedure can optionally
    be decreased to 20 Hz. In addition to the already specified configuration with
    eight loudspeakers, a sub-woofer can be included in the setup for this purpose."
