abstract:
- content: 'Energy consumption (EC) is a key metric to assess the energy efficiency
    of a service. When a service is operated over multiple domains under different
    authorities, sharing the EC data is challenging without a centralized authority.
    Given that, this work item aims to study how EC data can be trustworthily shared
    with PDL service. Specifically, this work item targets to address the following
    problems: Study the existing methods for fine-grained EC metering in physical
    and virtualized environments; study PDL service architecture enhancement for supporting
    E2E EC metering data collection; Study distributed consensus mechanisms for EC
    metering data post-verification and service enforcement with smart contracts.'
