  content: This document will identify and evaluate candidate (existing and new) satellite
    based system scenarios and architectures in the context of beyond 3G mobile &
    wireless systems. This document shall identify the technical enablers to demonstrate
    the relevance of such architectures in terms of radio interface features, ground
    and space technologies and inter-working schemes with terrestrial systems. It
    shall also determine the associated spectrum requirements.The document will also
    identify the recommended standards, which ETSI can create in future.
