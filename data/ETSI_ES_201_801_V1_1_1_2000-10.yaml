  content: "Due to the increasing numbers of consecutive interconnected networks,
    it is important to ensure the end-to-end performance of a voice quality. A possible
    way to solve this problem is to signal the actual performance parameters on a
    per call basis during call setup. As a first step, the stage 1 description for
    the Additional Network Feature is set out.\r\nReference document: EG 201 474 (DEG/STQ-00004)."
