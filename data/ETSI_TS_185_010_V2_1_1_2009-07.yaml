  content: The objective of this WI is to specify the protocols used on the reference
    points   internal to the Customer Premises Network (CPN), between the Customer
    Network Gateway and the Customer Network Devices (CNDs). The activity will be
    carried out on the basis of the stage 2 specifications related to CNG and CNDs
    produced by WG5 (see WI05012 and WI05015 deliverables) and will take into account
    the protocol suites already defined for the reference points between the CPN itself
    and the NGN. This will require a strict cooperation with WG3.
