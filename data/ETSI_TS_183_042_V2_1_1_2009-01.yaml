  content: "Stage 3 description for Call Completion on Busy Subscriber (CCBS) like
    service in TISPAN NGN IMS.\r\nIncluding an analysis of the re-use of the Tool-kit
    of 3GPP to deliver the service. If new capabilities are needed they should be
    defined in cooperation with 3GPP and in accordance with RFC3427.\r\nInteroperability
    between networks must be taken into consideration. \r\nInterworking between NGN
    and PSTN/ISDN will be specified."
