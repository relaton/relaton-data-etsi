  content: "This WI will  develop a report to study the internal architectural structure/physical
    components of an NFVI Nodeand provide a set of guidelines to support an NFV environment.
    The goai is to facilitate the availability of these components in a multi-vendor
    environment. The scope is limited to the Hardware Resources portion of Figure
    2 of the Infrastructure Overview GS INF001 V1.1.1. These Resources include the
    Compute, Storage, and Network hardware. Accordingly, this document will study:
    \r\n\r\n- Applicable Architectural Principles (e.g., Open Compute Project)\r\n-
    Physical Hardware Components\r\n- Node Construction (e.g., COTS Products, Rack
    Designs, Processors, Heating/Cooling Issues)\r\n- Interconnection Methods\r\n-
    Building NFVI Node Configurations with generic set of components (e.g., Transport,
    Access, Customer Prem, Provider Edge, etc.)\r\n- Support Various Use Cases specified
    in GS INF001 (e.g., Cloud Computing Services, Cloud Deployment Models, etc.)\r\n-
    Scaling Issues (Minimum configuration to support specified function, Stacking
    components to meet various node size requirements)\r\n\r\nThe proposed GS intends
    to cover these topics at an acceptable level of detail. It is expected that this
    study may highlight the need for additional requirements for individual components
    such as processors. Such requirements can then be pursued either in the ISG or
    in other SDOs as applicable.\r\n"
