  content: Create a standard based on EG 201 188 experience where a new common NTP
    interface is standardised. This should provide line equipment manufacturers, especially
    those using new technologies, with enough technical details to ensure an appropriate
    inter-working with the most common existing European terminals supporting the
    most successful service provided by PSTN.
