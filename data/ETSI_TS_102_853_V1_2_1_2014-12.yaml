abstract:
- content: "TS 102 853 v1.1.2 (2012-10) includes as obligatory some checks on signing
    certificate references (namely IssuerName and IssuerSerial) in addition to the
    check on the signing certificate digest reference. These checks on IssuerName
    and IssuerSerial are not necessary and at the same time lead to major interoperability
    issues and are a source for indeterminate validation results in many cases. This
    will be corrected (clauses 5.1.4.1, 5.1.4.2 and 5.1.4.3).\r\n"
