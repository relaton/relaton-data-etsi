abstract:
- content: "This Technical Specification provides a system wide view of the\r\noperation
    of discontinuous reception on the GSM system.\r\nThe support of DRX is mandatory
    in GSM PLMNs.\r\nThe detailed coding and procedural details are defined in the
    relevant\r\nTechnical Specifications dealing with the specific interfaces that
    are\r\ninvolved, for instance GSM 08.08 and GSM 04.08. Reference is also made\r\nto
    the framing on the air interface which is defined in Technical\r\nSpecification
    GSM 05.02.\r\nThe Technical Specification gives an overview of the implementation
    of\r\ndiscontinuous reception DRX within the GSM system, the actions\r\nrequired
    at MSC, BSS, and MS, the support of the facility via the air\r\ninterface, and
    some operational aspects of the facility.\r\n"
