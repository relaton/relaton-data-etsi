abstract:
- content: 'This Work Item will report on the functional architecture necessary to
    manage and provision connectivity for multi-site NFV services (i.e. over WANs,
    access networks). A set of multi-site use cases will be described, analyzed and
    used to produce a set of recommendations regarding: 1) multi-site services in
    terms of their supporting VNFFGs, VNFs, VLinks, CPs, etc., 2) multi-network connectivity
    at the infrastructure layer, and 3) mappings from the infrastructure connectivity
    to support the multi-site services and their associated functional entities.  The
    report will also examine MANO support for multi-site services, and identify the
    role of the WIM (ref. MAN001) and possible ramifications for other MANO functional
    entities and reference points.   Concepts and terminology defined in current IFA012
    and IFA009 documents will serve as a basis. EVE005 recommendations for WAN connectivity,
    #8-11, 20, 21, will be evaluated. VNF application specific functionality will
    not be considered. The connectivity study and recommendations will include endpoint
    discovery and management.   The deliverable will be informative.'
