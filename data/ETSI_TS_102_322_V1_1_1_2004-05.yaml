abstract:
- content: The WTVML Specification is a televisual, Internet compatible content authoring
    format based on XML. It has all the required elements, attributes and events necessary
    to describe the user interface and user interaction models for the majority of
    interactive TV services. It is based on work originally done for the WAP Forum
    (now the Open Mobile Alliance) to support the delivery of electronic point of  service
    (EPOS) applications to small foot print devices.
