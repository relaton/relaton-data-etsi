abstract:
- content: "The charging supplementary service is described in GSM 02.86 [2] and t\r\nhe
    relevant charging principles are given in the relevant GSM MoU Asso\r\nciation
    documents. These services are designed to supply to a mobile u\r\nser sufficient
    information to allow a real time estimate to be made of\r\nthe bill which will
    eventually be levied in the home PLMN on the Mobi\r\nle Station (MS) subscriber.\r\nIn
    the case of certain MS uses, for example a mobile payphone, this es\r\ntimate
    could be subject to further processing (e.g. to present the cha\r\nrges in currency,
    rather than units, this may include an additional ma\r\nrk up). This additional
    processing is not described in this ETS in ord\r\ner to avoid constraining the
    evolution of the MS product in this area.\r\nThis European Telecommunication Standard
    ETS gives an overall view of\r\nhow this supplementary service shall operate both
    in the PLMN and with\r\nin the MS. Text given in this ETS is required to define
    functionality\r\nand is not intended to constrain implementation.\r\n"
