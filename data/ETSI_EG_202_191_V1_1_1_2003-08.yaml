abstract:
- content: "This activity will identify key issues, solutions and actions for multimodal
    interaction, communication and navigation at the user interface with ICT systems
    and terminals.\r\nThis STF will focus on the dynamics of multimodal transactions/user
    dialogues for the full diversity of users of ICT systems and terminals. It will
    identify how simplifications, translations, sensory transpositions, or other presentation
    of content manipulations of a multimodal transaction can be used to improve ease
    of access.  These improvements are from a \"design for all\" perspective.\r\nSince
    the present guidelines take a \"design for all\" approach the key benefit of applying
    them will be to drive up the general quality and ease of use of a human/ICT interface
    while providing improved accessibility for people with motor, sensory or cognitive
    impairments.  The results of consultation with users and user groups about accessibility
    are reported.  These consultation results were combined with technology roadmaps
    to build scenarios of use from which a structured set of \"design for all\" guidelines
    were developed.\r\nThis STF will emphasise opportunities for simple generic Human
    Factors solutions, that are commercially attractive to network operators and equipment
    providers for delivery as a sustainable revenue generating activity, which open
    information and communications technologies to consumers who might otherwise be
    excluded. \r\nThe STF will deliver an ETSI Guide that will identify key Human
    Factors issues and potential solutions, and make recommendations to ETSI for the
    specific actions that need to be taken in this area. Where possible this should
    be supported by illustrations or examples.\r\n"
