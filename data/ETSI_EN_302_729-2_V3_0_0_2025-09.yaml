abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies technical characteristics and methods of
    measurements for LPR devices tilted from the vertical downwards direction \r\n
    (tilted downward installation). This radio equipment type is capable of operating
    in the frequency range 75 GHz to 85 GHz. The work includes a detailed description
    of the wanted performance criterion, RX-requirements and limits for all requirements
    based on a clear test procedure for tilted LPR devices. \r\nThe new standard reflects
    the technical requirements for tilted LPR devices as given by TR 103 595. The
    new standard shall be part 2 of the existing EN 302 729 series. \r\n"
