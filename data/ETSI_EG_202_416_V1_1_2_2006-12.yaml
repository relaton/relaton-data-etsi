abstract:
- content: The purpose of the proposed work is to develop a set of guidelines for
    user interface designers and developers, to be used as a reference in the design
    of understandable set-up procedures. These design guidelines will in particular
    consider specific requirements of different user groups and allow for alternative
    procedures, e.g. for blind users or old people.
