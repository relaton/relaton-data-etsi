  content: "Due to the increasing IT/Telco convergence, we have to deal with more
    and more AC-powered Infrastructure instead of the well known 48VDC Telco power-supply.
    For the continuous supply of these equipments, uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
    with AC-output are used.\r\nIn this document the demands (EMC-performance criterion
    and power-line influences) for UPS are specified. Particularly it is considered
    that the UPS may coexist with standard Telecom equipment. \r\nThe UPS is responsible
    for the continuous (uninterruptible) supply of Telecom equipment with alternating
    current.\r\n"
