  content: "The technical report gives an introduction to number portability and an
    overview of the current way in which number portability is being implemented in
    various countries.  The objective of the report is to inform the designers of
    TIPHON equipment and the implementers of TIPHON networks about the requirements
    they may have to comply with in different countries.  The report concentrates
    on the actual implementations which have been developed rather than the descriptions
    given in other standardisation documents because;\r\n-the standardisation work
    has been too late to influence many implementations\r\n-the objective is to help
    TIPHON networks fit into existing solutions\r\nThe report focuses on the technical
    implementations.  National strategies, responsibilities and charging are covered
    only to the extent necessary to outline the context for the technical solutions.\r\nThe
    report gives most emphasis to number portability in fixed networks.\r\nThe report
    is complimentary to other deliverables on number portability produced by ETSI.\r\n\r\n"
