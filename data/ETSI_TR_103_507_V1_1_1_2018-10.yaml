    and manufacturing domains based on a limited set of use cases and from available
    existing data models. It will include deployment and related services aspects.\r\nThis
    work is expected to be developed in close collaboration with AIOTI, the H2020
    Large Scale Pilots and with ETSI activities in  industry and manufacturing domains.\r\nFuther
    extensions are envisaged in the future to cover entirely the industry and manufacturing
    domains."
