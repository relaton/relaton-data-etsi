abstract:
- content: This work item describes how to enable closed-loop automation based on
    the ZSM architectural framework. The work item specifies how to automatically
    deploy and configure closed loops involving both the E2E service management domain
    and the management domains. Closed loops running within the managed entities are
    out-of-scope. The specification will include (i) means for coordination, delegation,
    escalation, etc. between closed loops, (ii) the use of policies, rules, intents
    and/or other forms of inputs to steer their behaviour, and (iii) interactions
    between closed loops and external entities. The deliverable will specify stage-2
    generic enablers and flexible procedures for closed-loop automation.
