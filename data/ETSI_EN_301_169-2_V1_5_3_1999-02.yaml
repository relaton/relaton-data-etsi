    operation and maintenance taking into account the\r\npossibilities offered by
    Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS).\r\nSpecifically, to standardise outdoor
    enclosures, focussing on cabinets\r\nfor use in \"open air climate\" for stationary
    use only, in a manner\r\ncompatible with existing 300 119 series.\r\nSupporting
    member organisations: AT&T, PKI, GPT, Siemens.\r\n  "
