  content: "This ETS defines a set of bearer\r\nservices to be provided to GSM PLMN
    subscribers by a GSM PLMN itself\r\nand in connection with other networks. This
    ETS should also\r\nbe used as a reference for defining the corresponding required
    mobile\r\nnetwork capabilities which are specified by means of the \"GSM PLMN\r\nconnection
    type\" concept, defined in GSM 03.10.\r\nThe recommended provision of the bearer
    services is under the control\r\nof the GSM MoU and is out of the scope of ETSI/TC/SMG.\r\nBearer
    services not included in this specification that require\r\nmodifications to the
    GSM signalling specifications should not be\r\nintroduced unilaterally by a mobile
    network operator.\r\n "
