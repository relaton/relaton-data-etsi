abstract:
- content: "The scope of this document is to provide a monitoring architecture for
    quality of experience. First, a clear and unambiguous terminology is described
    (service, quality, QoE etc.).\r\nA theoretical and abstract model -the ARCU model-
    is described in order to address theoretical aspects of quality of experience.
    An operational approximation of the ARCU model is described (QoE-layered model).
    Finally, specifications of a software agent implementing this operational QoE-layered
    model are described.\r\n"
