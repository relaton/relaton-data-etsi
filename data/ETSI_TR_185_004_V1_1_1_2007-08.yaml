  content: The objective of this WI is to analyse the possible architectures for the
    customer environment, combining different possibilities in terms of elements to
    be considered. In particular, the analysed architectures will cover the possibility
    of considering multiple content flows sources from the external environment, the
    presence of one or more than one customer gateway, or possibly excluding the adoption
    of a customer gateway. The detailed architectures of customer devices and customer
    network gateways will be addressed in other WIs and will take into account the
    possible alternatives analysed in this document.
