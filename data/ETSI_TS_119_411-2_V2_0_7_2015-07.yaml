abstract:
- content: "The policy and security requirements are defined in terms of requirements
    for the issuance, maintenance and life-cycle management of EU qualified certificates
    as defined in Regulation (EU) 910/2014. These policy and security requirements
    support three reference certificate policies for the issuance, maintenance and
    life-cycle management of EU qualified certificates issued to natural persons (including
    natural persons associated with a legal person), to legal persons and to web sites,
    respectively.\r\nThe present document does not specify how the requirements identified
    can be assessed by an independent party, including requirements for information
    to be made available to such independent assessors, or requirements on such assessors.
    The present document however provides in annex a check-list of the policy requirements
    specific to TSP issuing EU qualified certificates (as expressed in the present
    document) as well as all the requirements incorporated by reference to TS 119
    411-1 and TS 119 401, that can be used by the TSP to prepare an assessment of
    its practices against the present document and/or by the assessor when conducting
    the assessment for confirming that a TSP meets the requirements for issuing qualified
    certificates under Regulation (EU) NÂ° 910/2014.\r\n"
