abstract:
- content: "The Technical Specification provides speech transmission performance requirements
    and measurement methods for handset and handsfree functions of superwideband handheld
    terminals (including PDAs). The present document provides requirements in order
    to optimize the end to end quality perceived by users. \r\nStandardized superwideband
    coders are now available, some being also compatible with wideband coders.\r\nThe
    present document considers only conversational services (that may be mixed with
    other services) and does not cover the streaming-only services.\r\nSuch applications
    include:\r\n•\tSpeech communication for handset and handsfree functions. A special
    care is taken to ensure that the quality offered both by handset and handsfree
    functions is equivalent and that the quality in send direction is similar to superwideband
    terminals fulfilling TS 102 924 or TS 102 925.\r\n•\tWideband Bandwidth extension
    which may allow usage for some mixed content applications.\r\n"
