abstract:
- content: "When the physical interface is not accessible to an attached test tool,
    alternative methods for the verification of conformance requirements based on
    APDU communication on the UICC-terminal interface are needed. The LS C6-220198/SETTEC(22)000102
    from 3GPP WG CT6 is proposing a new verification method based on toolkit test
    events as one of the recommended test methods.\r\n\r\nThis Work Item defines the
    implementation of requirements defined in TS 102 240 for the CAT test events in
    TS 102 241. \r\n\r\nThe usage of the toolkit test event remains under the responsibility
    of the NAA specific test specifications (eg: 3GPP 31.127 and 3GPP 31.117, currently
    in development stage).\r\n\r\nThe scope of this Work Item is as below.\r\n- Implementation
    of the requirements for the CAT test events. \r\n- Implementation of the requirements
    for a mechanism in the CAT runtime environment for applets to register and deregister
    for the CAT test events.\r\n- Implementation of the requirements for a mechanism
    in the CAT runtime environment to trigger the CAT test events.\r\n- Implementation
    of security requirements to restrict the usage of the CAT test events to test
    purposes only."
