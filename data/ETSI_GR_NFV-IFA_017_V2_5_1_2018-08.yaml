abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 017 conducts NFV Release 2 maintenance. It corrects
    errors, ambiguities, misalignments, and applies editorial modifications (i.e.
    Corrections of category F and D as described in ETSI TWPs Annex L). This edition
    does not add or modify features, nor does it extend the scope of the former Release
    2 edition summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nIFA 017 defines the guidelines that have
    to be taken into account during the creation of a protocol-neutral Unified Modeling
    Language (UML) information model. These guidelines are informative for the general
    reader, but need to be followed when designing models for the ETSI NFV Information
    Model."
