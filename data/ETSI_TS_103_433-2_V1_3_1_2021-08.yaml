abstract:
- content: The goal of the present work item is to produce a revision that provides
    support for two additional video codecs, VVC and AV1, that have appeared on the
    market. These codecs come in addition to what the previous versions of TS 103
    433-2 V1.1.1 and V1.2.1 standardized, i.e. a single layer enhancement for HDR
    systems using a SMPTE ST.2084 transfer function, enabling high performance display
    adaptation.
