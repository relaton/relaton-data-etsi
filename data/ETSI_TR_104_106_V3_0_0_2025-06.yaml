abstract:
- content: This technical report describes the O-RAN Security Threat Modeling and
    Risk Assessment. It identifies assets to be protected, analyzes the O-RAN components
    for vulnerabilities, examines potential threats associated with those vulnerabilities,
    provides security principles which stakeholders should address when building a
    secure end-to-end O-RAN system and assesses the risks of the identified threats
    based on impact and likelihood factors.
