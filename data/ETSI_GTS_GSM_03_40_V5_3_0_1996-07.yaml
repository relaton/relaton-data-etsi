abstract:
- content: "This GTS describes the\r\npoint-to-point Short Message Service (SMS) of
    the GSM PLMN system. It\r\ndefines:\r\n- the services and service elements;\r\n-
    the network architecture;\r\n- the Service Centre functionality;\r\n- the MSC
    functionality (with regard to the SMS);\r\n- the routing requirements,\r\n- the
    protocols and protocol layering;\r\nfor the Teleservices 21 and 22, as specified
    in the GSM 02.03 (ETS 300\r\n502).\r\nThe use of radio resources for the transfer
    of short messages between\r\nthe MS and the MSC is described in GSM 04.11 (ETS
    300 559)\r\nPoint-to-Point Short Message Service Support on Mobile Radio\r\nInterface
    , and is dealt with in that specification.\r\nThe network aspects of Short Message
    Service provision are outside the\r\nscope of this specification (i.e. the provision
    of network\r\nconnectivity between the PLMN subsystems). The required and assumed\r\nnetwork
    service offered to the higher layers is defined in this\r\nspecification.\r\nThe
    Cell Broadcast Short Message Service (Teleservice 23) is a\r\nseparate service,
    and is described in GSM 03.41 (ETS 300 537)\r\nTechnical Realization of the Short
    Message Service - Cell Broadcast .\r\n"
