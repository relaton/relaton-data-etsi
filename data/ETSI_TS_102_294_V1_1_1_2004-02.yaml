abstract:
- content: Based on the BSM generic architectures, this work item will define the
    architectures that BSMs will use for delivering IP multicast traffic. These architectures
    will include non-routed as well as routed solutions. While not specifying any
    routing protocol, it is assumed that the architectures will use at least IGMP-
    and PIM-based solutions as will be specified in other BSM Technical Specifications.
    The archictectures will also refer to work already performed in the IETF in the
    multicast working groups as well as in the unidirectional link routing group.
