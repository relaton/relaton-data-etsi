abstract:
- content: "The present document defines an electronic interface between two systems
    for the exchange of information relating to the establishment and management of
    Lawful Interception. Typically this interface would be used between: on one side,
    a Communications Service Provider; and, on the other side, a Law Enforcement Agency
    who is entitled to request Lawful Interception.\r\nThe present document is a specific
    and detailed example of one particular Warrantry interface.\r\nThe present document
    also supports Lawful Disclosure, which encompasses the various processes that
    deal with requests for data stored within the CSP domain, on behalf of a government
    authorised organisation.\r\nThis revision is for: Addition of ETSI TS 103 707
    to the ManifestSpecification Dictionary; Clarification for linking objects in
    the simple workflow profile; Refactoring Traffic Policies; Addition of JSON encoding;
    Addition of Workflow Profile for LI; Inclusion of link to preservation request;
    Addition of LPTask Object to support preservations; Correct typos and clarify
    states in LDTask Status Dictionaries."
