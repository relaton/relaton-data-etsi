abstract:
- content: "The present document defines an electronic interface between two systems
    for the exchange of information relating to the establishment and management of
    Lawful Interception. Typically this interface would be used between: on one side,
    a Communications Service Provider; and, on the other side, a Law Enforcement Agency
    who is entitled to request Lawful Interception.\r\nThe present document is a specific
    and detailed example of one particular Warrantry interface.\r\nThe present document
    also supports Lawful Disclosure, which encompasses the various processes that
    deal with requests for data stored within the CSP domain, on behalf of a government
    authorised organisation.\r\n\r\nThis revision is to provide the following: Moving
    attachments to the Forge; Support for LocationPush request; Addition of transmission
    date to alternative preservation references; Handling of list-type fields; Clarification
    of usage of ListOfTrafficPolicyReferences field; Addition of TrafficPolicy Workflow;
    Delivery and Deliver clarifications; Corrections to clauses referenced in XML
    Dictionary; Correction of ListOfTrafficPolicyReferences field; Corrections in
    Table C.1; Addition of CountryCode to LIST query parameters; Correction to cross
    reference clause number."
