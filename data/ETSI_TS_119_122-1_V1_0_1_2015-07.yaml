abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies CAdES digital signatures. CAdES signatures
    are built on CMS signatures, by incorporation of signed and unsigned attributes,
    which fulfil certain common requirements (such as the long term validity of digital
    signatures, for instance) in a number of use cases.\r\nThe present document specifies
    the ASN.1 definitions for the aforementioned attributes as well as their usage
    when incorporating them to CAdES signatures.\r\nThe present document specifies
    formats for CAdES baseline signatures, which provide the basic features necessary
    for a wide range of business and governmental use cases for electronic procedures
    and communications to be applicable to a wide range of communities when there
    is a clear need for interoperability of digital signatures used in electronic
    documents.\r\nThe present document defines four levels of CAdES baseline signatures
    addressing incremental requirements to maintain the validity of the signatures
    over the long term, in a way that a certain level always addresses all the requirements
    addressed at levels that are below it. Each level requires the presence of certain
    CAdES attributes, suitably profiled for reducing the optionality as much as possible.\r\n"
