abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this technical specification (TS) is to identify the\r\nMSC/IWFs
    and requirements to support interworking between:\r\ni) PLMN and PSTN\r\nii) PLMN
    and ISDN\r\nIt is not possible to treat ISDN and PSTN as one type of network,
    even\r\nwhen both ISDN and PSTN subscribers are served by the same exchange\r\nbecause
    of the limitations of the PSTN subscribers access ie analogue\r\nconnection without
    D-channel signalling.\r\nWithin this TS, the requirements for voice and non-voice
    (data) calls\r\nare considered separately.\r\n  "
