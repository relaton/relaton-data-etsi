  content: Many companies are running studies on estimating energy performance of
    future radio access networks (RAN) deployment. In this work item we want to find
    methods and best practice to assess energy performance (Energy Consumption, Energy
    Efficiency) of a future RAN deployment . The work will start with collecting important
    preconditions as traffic aspects (growth,  new traffic classes,  potential disruption),
    collection of energy efficiency/saving solutions and strategies and energy issues
    in current networks.  Network energy performance will be assessed based on set
    of scenarios including different solutions. The time period is 2020, optionally
    beyond and 5G impact. Energy consumption and efficiency definitions from  ES 202706
    and ES 203228 are preferred.
