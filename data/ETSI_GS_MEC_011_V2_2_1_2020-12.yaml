  content: This work item focuses on the enhancement and maintenance of Mp1 reference
    point between MEC applications and MEC platform, that allows those applications
    to interact with the MEC system. This includes both updating the existing features
    and defining new features, such as filling any gaps in support of other services
    (e.g., application mobility support). It will describe the information flows,
    required information, and as applicable, will specify the necessary operations,
    data model and data format.
