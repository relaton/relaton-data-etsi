- content: "Identify the necessary functionality and IN architecture to support\r\nCTM.
    In particular it is proposed to study the following aspects:\r\n- Identify the
    functional architecture for the support of CTM;\r\n- Identify the new FE and Reference
    Points for the support of CTM in\r\nIN (if any);\r\n- Identify the additional
    functionality to the existing IN-CS1/2 FEs\r\n(if required).\r\nIn a second step
    the analysis could include other aspects as for\r\nexample:\r\n- Requirements
