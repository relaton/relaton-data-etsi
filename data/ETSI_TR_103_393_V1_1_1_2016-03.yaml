abstract:
- content: "This Work Item will build on the Advanced Mobile Location initiative that
    has been piloted in the UK to improve the precision and accuracy of location information
    for emergency calls.\r\nAdvanced Mobile Location (AML) allows use of native smart
    phone technology to pass (Assisted) GPS or WiFi based location data to Emergency
    Service PSAPs. These technologies can provide a location precision as good as
    5 metres (and averaging to within ~25m circular areas), a significant improvement
    on existing cell coverage provided by mobile networks, which average (across the
    UK) circular areas of about 1.75km radius.\r\nAML functionality is triggered by
    an emergency call (which is unaffected) and is designed to supplement the basic
    network location wherever possible, i.e. with some acknowledgement of limitations
    in GPS or Wifi availability and time to acquire location of GPS.  The UK implementation
    uses an SMS message to transport location information established by the handset,
    using its built-in GPS and WiFi connectivity and user plane assistance data.\r\nThe
    scope of the work will be to:\r\n- Review the way AML has been implemented in
    the UK \r\n- Consider how AML can be used with different PSAP arrangements that
    exist in Europe \r\n- Consider how AML can be extended to cover the case of handsets
    that roam \r\n- Optimise the content of the SMS message to be of most use to the
    emergency services\r\n- Document the results of the Work Item in a TR for reference
    by administrations, mobile networks and handset manufacturers.\r\nIt is noted
    that AML does not introduce or require any new technical standards: it uses existing,
    widely available 3GPP network standards and needs only limited changes to handset
    operating systems.  \r\n"
