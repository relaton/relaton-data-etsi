  content: "This document will discuss various design options, in terms of a set of
    new stand-alone and/or nested Functional Blocks, for using intent with the ENI
    System Architecture. This includes accepting, translating and validating intent
    statements, determining how intent affects the goals and operation of the ENI
    system, and how it is used by business users, application developers, and network
    administrators. This document provides a set of recommendations and conclusions
    whose main scope is GS ENI 005 [i.1] Rel 2. However, the contents of this document
    also affect other GSs and GRs(e.g., ENI 001, ENI 002 [i.2], and ENI 004 [i.3]).\r\n"
