abstract:
- content: "This ETS will specify a subset of ISO/IEC 13816-6 (DSM-CC) for basic multimedia
    applications using MHEG-5.  The subset will encompass DSM-CC User-User (U-U) primitives
    for communication between client and server.  It will include a mapping of MHEG-5
    to DSM-CC.\r\nNote: DSM-CC is a session layer protocol covering establishment
    and management of end-to-end sessions.  Basic multimedia applications include
    (eg, as defined by DAVIC) Television distribution, near Video on Demand, Video
    on Demand and Teleshopping."
