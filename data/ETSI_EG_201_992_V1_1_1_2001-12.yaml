abstract:
- content: "The scope of this ETSI Guide is to cover the standardisation of functions
    to allow interworking of Intelligent networks and Internet protocols. Covering:\r\n-
    Signalling requirements on the Internet protocols User Agent (UA) function to
    Service Control Gateway (SCG) function;\r\n- Signalling requirements to support
    Internet protocols between the SCG function and the other IN functional entities;\r\n
    -Signalling requirements to specific services between the SCG function and the
    other IN functional entities;\r\n- Architectures for the deployment of IP in the
    circuit Switched Network, including IN entities;\r\n- Use of IN Service Control
    Points (SCP) as platforms to support IP/IN Gatekeeper functions;\r\n- Security
    aspects also need to be addressed."
