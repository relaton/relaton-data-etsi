  content: This present document presents the high-level QoS requirements for the
    home network (HN) for the carriage of DVB services. In the present document an
    agreed set of high-level technical requirements for QoS is defined that can be
    used as input to the relevant technical groups and organisations for the development
    of such QoS mechanisms. Although this work has been done within DVB, primarily
    with the DVB Home Network in mind, it is applicable to any IP-based home network.
