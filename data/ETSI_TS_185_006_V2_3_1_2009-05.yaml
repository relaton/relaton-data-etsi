abstract:
- content: provide maintenance to the TS 185 006 document defining will define the
    Stage 2 Customer Devices specifications, including architectural building blocks
    to be included in the customer Devices  to support the interworking with NGN architecture,
    both for the transport layers (NASS, RACS) and for the service layer. The WI will
    also define the interfaces between the NGN architectural blocks involved and the
    corresponding customer devices  functions here defined (for the cases in what
    the CNG will be transparent for the service and/or transport layer point of view),
    as well as between the Customer Devices and the CNG when appropriate. The WI will
    perform, as first step, a categorisation of the different user equipment with
    reference to the type of service supported and the different levels of implementation
    of the related functionalities.
