abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) gives the detailed\r\nrequirements
    for the correct operation of the background acoustic\r\nnoise evaluation, noise
    parameter encoding/decoding and comfort noise\r\ngeneration in Mobile Stations
    (MSs) and Base Station Systems (BSSs)\r\nduring Discontinuous Transmission (DTX)
    on enhanced full rate speech\r\ntraffic channels.\r\nThe requirements described
    in this ETS are mandatory for\r\nimplementation in all GSM MSs capable of supporting
    the enhanced full\r\nrate speech traffic channel.\r\nThe receiver requirements
    are mandatory for implementation in all GSM\r\nBSSs capable of supporting the
    enhanced full rate speech traffic\r\nchannel, the transmitter requirements only
    for those where downlink\r\nDTX will be used.\r\n  "
