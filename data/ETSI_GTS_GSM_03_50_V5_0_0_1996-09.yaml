abstract:
- content: "This GTS is concerned with the transmission planning aspects\r\npertaining
    to the speech service in the pan-European PLMN system. Due\r\nto technical and
    economic factors, there cannot be full compliance\r\nwith the general characteristics
    of international telephone\r\nconnections and circuits recommended by CCITT.\r\nThis
    GTS gives guidance as to the precautions, measures and minimum\r\nrequirements
    needed for successful interworking of the PLMN with the\r\nnational and international
    PSTN. The Recommendation identifies a\r\nnumber of routeing and network configurations.
    The objective is to\r\nreach a quality as close as possible to CCITT standards
    in order to\r\nsafeguard the performance seen by PSTN customers.\r\n "
