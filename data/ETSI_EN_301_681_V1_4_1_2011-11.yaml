abstract:
- content: "Following the WRC-03 decision to allocate to MSS the bands 1518-1525 MHz
    (downlink) and 1668-1675 MHz (uplink) and the conclusions of  WRC-07, this contribution
    is to propose the necessary changes to harmonise the use of these extended frequency
    bands by MESs .\r\n\r\nThe proposed changes specify additional out-of-band emission
    and spurious requirements for MESs that can operate in the additional 1668 MHz
    to 1675 MHz frequency band made available by the WRC-03/07 decisions."
