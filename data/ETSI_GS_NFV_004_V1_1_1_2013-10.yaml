  content: "This WI specifies the requirements on Network Functions Virtualisation
    in order to consolidate network equipment, belonging to fixed and mobile networks,
    onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage, which could
    be located in Datacentres, Network Nodes and in end user premises. This work will
    address the requirements on the following areas: Portability/Interoperability.
    \ Performance. Elasticity Security  Resiliency.  Network Stability.  Service continuity
    Operations Energy Efficiency  Migration and co-existence with existing platforms.
    And will address high level requirements for the virtualisation domains, i.e.
    Infrastructure domain, applications domain and management and orchestration domain
    as well as the requirements inherent to the interactions amongst them\r\n"
