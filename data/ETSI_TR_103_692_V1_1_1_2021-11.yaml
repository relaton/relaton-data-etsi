  content: "This technical report proposes to investigate the security issues for
    managing state in, and for the appropriateness of using, stateful hash-based signature
    schemes in different deployment environments. This report does not intend to investigate
    such usage in specific hardware or software products. This report will investigate
    usage abstractly in contexts such as, but not necessarily limited to, hardware
    security modules, smart cards, Public Key Infrastructure, and for firmware or
    software signing.\r\nThis informative report will reference the stateful hash-based
    signature specifications from the Crypto Forum Research Group (RFC 8391, and 8554),
    as well as the forthcoming NIST Special Publication on stateful hash-based signature
    schemes.\r\n\tThis proposed Technical Report intends to help a reader determine
    if a given deployment scenario is a suitable context for stateful hash-based signature
    algorithms by discussing the characteristics of such schemes, and by identifying
    potential security risks associated with managing state. Examples of both appropriate
    use-cases as well as inappropriate use-cases will be given. Following, the report
    intends to give guidance on how to best mitigate the identified potential vulnerabilities
    and security risks associated with state management. \r\n"
