abstract:
- content: The purpose of the present document is to provide information on prominent
    control loop architectures that can be used in modular system design. This will
    be applied to the ENI reference system architecture (and any other applicable
    ETSI reports and standards). The present document will emphasize control loops
    that are adaptive and cognitive
