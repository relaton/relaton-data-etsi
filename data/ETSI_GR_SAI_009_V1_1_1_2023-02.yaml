  content: This work item aims to specify a security framework of AI computing platform
    containing hardware and basic software to protect valuable assets like models
    and data deployed on AI computing platform when they are used in runtime or stored
    at rest. The security framework consists of security components in AI computing
    platform and security mechanisms executed by security components in the platform.
    By specifying the security framework, AI computing platform can be consolidated
    against the relevant attack and able to provide security capabilities to facilitate
    the stakeholders in AI systems to better protect the valuable assets(model/data)
    on AI computing platform.The study will use SAI-006 as a start point for hardware
    aspects and avoid overlap with SAI-006
