abstract:
- content: "Wireless Backhaul is a key asset in building Operators transport networks
    not only for reaching locations not yet connected by fibre, but also to provide
    effective disaster recovery networks and fibre back-up.\r\n\r\nRural areas, mountain
    sites and islands require long reliable MW links: hops longer than 20-30km rely
    on frequency bands lower than 10GHz thanks to reduced rain attenuation and favorable
    propagation conditions\r\n\r\nThis WI goal is to asses the importance of low frequency
    bands collecting information about:\r\n\r\nThe current use by Fixed Services of
    the bands lower than 10GHz including statistics in terms of number of links (absolute
    and/or relative to the other frequency bands) by region and if available with
    the hop length distribution.\r\nFuture use of 7 and 8 GHz bands as key bands for
    granting a smooth migration from 6GHz\r\nApplications\r\nTechnical considerations
    of why a band below 10 GHz is necessary to deploy long haul links"
