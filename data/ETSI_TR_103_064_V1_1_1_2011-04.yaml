abstract:
- content: "The scope of this work item is to describe the business and cost considerations
    to deploy RRS technologies in the Public Safety domain. The work item will examine
    both the introduction of new communication systems based on RRS and the evolution
    of existing public safety communication systems with RRS capabilities. \r\nIn
    particular, the work item will investigate the following topics: \r\n- impact
    of RRS on the current life cycle and cost model for public safety communication
    equipment and major applicable changes and enhancements.\r\n- identification of
    the benefits and disadvantages of RRS technology in comparison to conventional
    communication systems.\r\n- definition of a business model able to develop the
    capabilities offered by RRS adoption and to lower the life cycle costs associated
    with RRS introduction.\r\n"
