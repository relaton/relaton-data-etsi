  content: This work item will specify the non-functional requirements of reliability
    for NFV-based services. In some use cases, the NFV MANO functions may lead to
    reliability issues. For example, the NFV MANO functions bring several challenges
    as lack of failure detection and performance monitor, the consistency of long
    running functions and possible conflicting decisions made by different functions.
    The non-functional requirements scope of reliability  mainly includes failure
    alarm and processing requirements, the requirements for meeting the reliability
    expectation, the requirements for recovery and redundancy. The resulting deliverable
    will contain normative provisions.
