abstract:
- content: "This work item documents the key issues and solutions for MEC integration
    in 5G networks. Particularly, the following aspects are addressed: MEC Application
    Function C-plane interactions with 5GC, including the mapping of MEC procedures
    to procedures used in 3GPP 5G system, options for functional split between MEC
    and 5G Common API frameworks, organization of MEC as Application Function(s) of
    5G system and pertinent interactions with the (R)AN. \r\nIn addition this work
    item addresses the scope and the preferred way of documenting the identified future
    technical work from this work item. Identification of any yet missing 5G system
    functionality is also in the scope of the study.\r\n"
