abstract:
- content: The present document collects test setups and test methods for headsets
    which use human structure-borne voice as an additional input signal to the airborne
    transmitted voice of the near end talker. The work includes test setup description
    and validation procedures and tests focusing on the time variant behaviour of
    signal processing used in headsets.
