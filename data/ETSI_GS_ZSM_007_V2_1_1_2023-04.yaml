abstract:
- content: ZSM 007 provides a glossary of terms and concepts related to Zero touch
    network and Service Management (ZSM) with the goal to achieve a common language
    and understanding across all the ETSI ISG ZSM deliverables and the aim is to propose
    it as a terminology reference for use across other standardization organizations,
    open-source projects, and the industry. Where necessary, verbose descriptions
    providing background for formal concise definitions are documented. This edition
    adds terms and definitions that have emerged since the precedent publication.
