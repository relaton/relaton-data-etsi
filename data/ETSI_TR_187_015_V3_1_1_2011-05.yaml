abstract:
- content: "This document describes how to counteract the occurrence of Unsolicited
    Communications (UC) in the NGN. This document will be a technical report (TR).
    \r\nIt addresses the methodologies on preventing the terminating party from receiving
    UC and also addresses the legal implications.\r\nIn the context of NGN scenario
    definitions the applicability, effectiveness and architectural instantiation of
    UC prevention methods are described.\r\nRelevant objectives and requirements will
    be identified for extending the NGN architecture by signalling and security.\r\nThe
    architectural enhancements on the NGN will be identified i.e.\r\n·Home networks,
    focusing on interconnection from the CNG with the NGN and interaction between
    the CNG and CND. \r\nAnd proposing UC detection & handling on the CNG.\r\n·Enterprise
    networks, focusing in interconnection between the NGCN and the NGN and the interaction
    between the UE and the NGCN and NGN. \r\nAnd proposing UC detection & handling
    for NGCN devices\r\n·Single user scenario, focusing on interconnection between
    the UE and the NGN. \r\nAnd proposing a UC detection & handling framework for
    entities of the NGN.\r\nThe TR will be based and closely aligned with existing
    and ongoing work within TISPAN and other SDOs with the goal to define a comprehensive
    solution which could be applied in the whole NGN.\r\nNote:. PUC for IMS (mechanisms,
    interconnection points, interfaces and protocols) shall not be described here."
