abstract:
- content: This WI describes a set of methodologies that combine risk assessment and
    testing. It distinguishes between risk-based testing (risk assessment to improve
    the testing) and test-based risk assessment (using testing to improve the risk
    assessment). A methodology in the sense of this WI describes a collection of systematically
    aligned activities with associated rules, methods and best practices to achieve
    a certain goal or result. The methodologies are based on  standards like ISO 31000
    and IEEE 829/29119.
