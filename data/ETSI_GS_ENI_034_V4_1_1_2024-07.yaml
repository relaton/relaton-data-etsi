abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this work item is to provide additional information concerning
    Policy local conflict detection. This GS expands on the work done in GS ENI 005,
    clause 6.3.9.6.3, to provide additional requirements and procedures to ensure
    that a new policy will not conflict with any currently deployed policies in the
    same administrative domain.\r\nThis GS also describes the input(s), output(s),
    Internal Reference Points, and functionality of every step in the Policy local
    conflict detection process. \r\nIf policies with potential risks are dispatched,
    they may lead to various errors in the network and cause instability and harm.
    However, as the scale of the network increases, the difficulty and cost of detecting
    and correcting network errors also increases. Therefore, we have refined the process
    of the original policy validation Functional Block and clarified the operation
    of the internal functions and interaction process of Policy local conflict detection.
    . This will potentially save time and reduce misconfigurations. Consequently,
    the stability and availability of the system will be increased.\r\nThis GS will
    encompass research and investigation activities that will address IP networks
    at the first stage. Subsequent efforts may extend the work into telecommunication
    networks."
