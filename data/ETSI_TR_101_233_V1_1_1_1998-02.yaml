    It is primarily aimed broadcasters and telecommunications\r\nnetwork operators

    of services within the Vertical Blanking Interv\r\nal of 625/50 PAL derived services
    in Europe.\r\nThe main area of interest is in the VBI as recievd at home, and
    thus t\r\nhe effects of all the telecommunication systems that are used to conve\r\ny
    the signal must be taken into account.\r\n"
