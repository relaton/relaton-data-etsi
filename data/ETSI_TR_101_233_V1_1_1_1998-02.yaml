  content: "This  TR is intended as a companion document to the specifications, ET\r\nS
    300 706 and ETS 300 708, covering the data format and transmission v\r\nia Teletext.
    It is primarily aimed broadcasters and telecommunications\r\nnetwork operators
    with the intention that there is a consistent appro\r\nach to the positioning
    of services within the Vertical Blanking Interv\r\nal of 625/50 PAL derived services
    in Europe.\r\nThe main area of interest is in the VBI as recievd at home, and
    thus t\r\nhe effects of all the telecommunication systems that are used to conve\r\ny
    the signal must be taken into account.\r\n"
