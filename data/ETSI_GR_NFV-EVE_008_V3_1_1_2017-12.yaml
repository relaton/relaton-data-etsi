  content: "The present document studies use cases and charging triggers for usage
    metering of virtualised resources. It proposes new functional blocks for 1) the
    collection and provision of accounting information, and 2) the triggering of charging
    requests. \r\nThe interfaces (and information flows) between the proposed functional
    blocks and the current NFV Architectural Framework are part of the study.\r\nThe
    following models have been taken into account: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
    and VNF as a Service (VNFaaS).\r\nThe present document includes recommendations
    to either modify existing or new specifications, or both.  \r\nWhile management
    and orchestration event charging for VNFaasS is part of the present work, usage
    event charging for VNFaaS is for further study."
