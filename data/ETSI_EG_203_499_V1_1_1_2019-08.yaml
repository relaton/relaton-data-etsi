abstract:
- content: " The EG will update the terminology list of EG 202 132 to include relevant
    terms for upcoming device and service features and will extend the list to include
    the 5 most frequently spoken languages in the EU and EFTA (English, French, German,
    Italian, Spanish). The scope of the EG will be limited to general and generic
    terms and will not, in any way, prevent manufacturers and service operators to
    introduce specific and/or proprietary terms for special or unique features that
    they wish to offer."
