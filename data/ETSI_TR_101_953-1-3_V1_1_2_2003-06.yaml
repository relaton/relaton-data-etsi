  content: "The present v1.1.2 of TR 101 953-1-3 is a purely editorial revision of
    the v1.1.1 in order to correct the corrupted figure 10. and some other minor error
    in the doc. The original (v1.1.1) scope of the deliverable is below: \r\n\r\nThe
    purposeof this Work Item is to produce an ETSI Technical Report (TR) document
    containing test specifications for DSL splitters. The main objectives are:\r\n*
    to correlate the splitter parameters with respect to the performance objectives
    of DSL, \r\n  POTS and ISDN servicesto assist the on going standardisation process
    (production of the\r\n  multi-part ES: \"European Specific Splitter Requirements\"
    (ES-splitters))\r\n* to specify unified and generic testing methods for all splitters
    based on the requirements specified in the TR 101 728, TS 101 388 and TS 101 270
    taking into account additional ITU-T DSL recommendations and possible other relevant
    Standards as from CENELEC.\r\n* to vaidate the testing methodsused to perform
    practical mesurement in implementing executable test suites on existing platforms
    (in accredited labs),\r\n* to provide as an input to TM6 and TC-AT the related
    test specifications possibly intended\r\n  to be included within the ES-Splitter
    and\r\n* to liaise with possible Bake-Off eventsto be organized by the ETSI B-O
    support team. The\r\n  objective being to confirm splitter parameters with respect
    to services (POTS, ISDN, and\r\n  DSL) performance objectives or to evaluate the
    performance degradation when inserting\r\n  splitters in local loops.\r\nIt is
    envisaged to co-operate with WG ATa in order to cover the testing methods for
    all DSL splitter specifications including the low-pass section of POTS splitters.\r\nThe
    following splitters are included within the scope of the present work item: ADSL/POT(with
    ot without HPF), ADSL/ISDN-BA, VDSL/POTS (with or without HPF), VDSL/ISDN-BA."
