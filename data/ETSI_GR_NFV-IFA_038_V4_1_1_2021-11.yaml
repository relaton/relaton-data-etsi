abstract:
- content: This work item will study and report about the necessary capabilities of
    the NFV framework to support the management of network connectivity, and its associated
    network resources, for VNFs based on containers. Examples of study include the
    support of multiple network interfaces per container, management of cluster nodes
    network and external VNF connectivity. The produced deliverable is expected to
    provide use cases, solutions and recommendations for normative work. The resulting
    deliverable of this work item will be informative.
