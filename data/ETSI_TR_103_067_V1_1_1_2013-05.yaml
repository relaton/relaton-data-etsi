abstract:
- content: "This technical report aims to identify the relevant RF scenarios and RF
    performances applicable to Cognitive Radio Systems for: · Coexistence between
    Cognitive Radio Systems when such Cognitive Radio Systems are operating in UHF
    TV band White Spaces; · Deployments scenarios in the UHF TV band WS including
    advanced incumbent protection techniques and implementations such as cooperative
    sensing and additional RF attributes for advanced geo-location database.  · Coexistence
    studies in UHF TV band White Spaces in regions outside of CEPT responsibility;
    RF scenarios to be considered in this study are the ones elaborated within ETSI
    TC RRS and in particular based on TR 102 907 \"Use cases for Operation in White
    Space Frequency Bands\" and within CEPT in draft ECC Report 159 \"Technical and
    operational requirements for the possible operation of cognitive radio systems
    in the 'White spaces' of the frequency band 470-790 MHZ\".  It should be noted
    that CEPT investigated preliminarily the practicability of implementation of new/future
    applications within the white space spectrum in the band 470 - 862 MHz in CEPT
    Report 24. This was prior the licensing of 790 - 862 MHz band to MBB. More recently
    further investigations were conducted by CEPT (by the Spectrum Engineering group
    43) and were published in the draft ECC Report 159 \"Technical and operational
    requirements for the possible operation of cognitive radio systems in the 'White
    spaces' of the frequency band 470-790 MHZ\". CEPT mainly focused on the protection
    of the incumbent users and of the services operating in bands adjacent to the
    band 470-790 MHz. CEPT studies, which are based on the spectrum usage and expected
    deployments in CEPT, may not be applicable to other regions of the world. However
    it is expected that the CEPT work will be taken into account in this technical
    report. RRS will use the ETSI liaison with CEPT to avoid overlap and inform on
    the progress of the feasibility study. This technical report should not duplicate
    with the studies being done in CEPT. If additional studies relevant for CEPT are
    identified, CEPT will be asked to carry them out. This technical report will address
    additional studies not relevant for CEPT. For instance as the spectrum usage may
    differ from countries or regions, it is anticipated to have region or country
    specific scenarios e.g. Region 1 and Region 3. As a possible output of this technical
    report, proposals for device classes can be elaborated.  The technical report
    can prepare for standardization work later on. In the present text, Cognitive
    Radio Systems operating in UHF TV band White Spaces exclude PMSE systems. \r\r\r\n"
