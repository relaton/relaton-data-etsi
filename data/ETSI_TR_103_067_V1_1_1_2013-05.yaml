  content: "This technical report aims to identify the relevant RF scenarios and RF
    performances applicable to Cognitive Radio Systems for:  Coexistence between Cognitive
    Radio Systems when such Cognitive Radio Systems are operating in UHF TV band White
    Spaces;  Deployments scenarios in the UHF TV band WS including advanced incumbent
    protection techniques and implementations such as cooperative sensing and additional
    RF attributes for advanced geo-location database.   Coexistence studies in UHF
    TV band White Spaces in regions outside of CEPT responsibility; RF scenarios to
    be considered in this study are the ones elaborated within ETSI TC RRS and in
    particular based on TR 102 907 \"Use cases for Operation in White Space Frequency
    Bands\" and within CEPT in draft ECC Report 159 \"Technical and operational requirements
    for the possible operation of cognitive radio systems in the 'White spaces' of
    the frequency band 470-790 MHZ\".  It should be noted that CEPT investigated preliminarily
    the practicability of implementation of new/future applications within the white
    space spectrum in the band 470 - 862 MHz in CEPT Report 24. This was prior the
    licensing of 790 - 862 MHz band to MBB. More recently further investigations were
    conducted by CEPT (by the Spectrum Engineering group 43) and were published in
    the draft ECC Report 159 \"Technical and operational requirements for the possible
    operation of cognitive radio systems in the 'White spaces' of the frequency band
    470-790 MHZ\". CEPT mainly focused on the protection of the incumbent users and
    of the services operating in bands adjacent to the band 470-790 MHz. CEPT studies,
    which are based on the spectrum usage and expected deployments in CEPT, may not
    be applicable to other regions of the world. However it is expected that the CEPT
    work will be taken into account in this technical report. RRS will use the ETSI
    liaison with CEPT to avoid overlap and inform on the progress of the feasibility
    study. This technical report should not duplicate with the studies being done
    in CEPT. If additional studies relevant for CEPT are identified, CEPT will be
    asked to carry them out. This technical report will address additional studies
    not relevant for CEPT. For instance as the spectrum usage may differ from countries
    or regions, it is anticipated to have region or country specific scenarios e.g.
    Region 1 and Region 3. As a possible output of this technical report, proposals
    for device classes can be elaborated.  The technical report can prepare for standardization
    work later on. In the present text, Cognitive Radio Systems operating in UHF TV
    band White Spaces exclude PMSE systems. \r\r\r\n"
