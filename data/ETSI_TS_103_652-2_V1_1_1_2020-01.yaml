abstract:
- content: "Develop a Technical Specification defining the system architecture for
    the operation of an Evolved Licensed Shared Access System, enabling the provision
    of spectrum access to local high-quality wireless networks in licensed bands.
    The architecture builds on the feasibility study described in ETSI TR 103 588
    (2018) \"Reconfigurable Radio Systems (RRS); Feasibility study on temporary spectrum
    access for local high-quality wireless networks\", and the system requirements
    captured in ETSI TS 103 652  “System Requirements for spectrum access for local
    high-quality wireless networks” (DTS/RRS-0150). The scope of the work will be
    to define the evolved LSA architecture such as to accommodate and enable spectrum
    access for many local high-quality wireless networks in dedicated licensed and
    leasing scenarios based on the requirements developed in TS 103 652-1. \r\nThe
    specification will include:   - functional architecture   - Identification of
    the different entities, reference points, and mapping of functions to entities
    \  - Identification of interfaces to be standardized   - High level procedures
    and information flows enabling assignment and handling of spectrum for the different
    scenarios."
