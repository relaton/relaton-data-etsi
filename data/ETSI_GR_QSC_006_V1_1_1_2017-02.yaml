abstract:
- content: 'Informational document to explain the upper limits of quantum computing
    power in the context of cryptography. Analysis is based on very conservative assumptions,
    in particular, explanation on  what the upper limit implies for applying Groverâ€™s
    algorithm to finding a symmetric key.    '
