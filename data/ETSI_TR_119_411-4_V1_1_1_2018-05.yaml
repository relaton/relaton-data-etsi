abstract:
- content: "The document will merge the existing checklists provided as annex to EN
    319 411-1 and 319 411-2 respectively, into 1 single checklist covering CPs specified
    in both document.\r\nEach requirement will be listed and its applicability to
    a CP will be pointed by a cross.\r\nWhen a requirement is a reference to a requirement
    specified in another document, such requirement will be listed under the main
    requirement and pointed as applicable.\r\nThe column « short description » in
    the existing checklist will be removed; since each requirement is now clearly
    identified only the identifier will be listed.\r\nA new column will be added for
    “qualified” policies to indicate where applicable the eIDAS article/sub item met
    by a specific ETSI QCP requirement.  This can be based on 319 411-2 Annex A.\r\n"
