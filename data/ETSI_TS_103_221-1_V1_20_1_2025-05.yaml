abstract:
- content: "The internal network interface covers wide area connections between LI
    systems and (depending on the network) lots of network elements from different
    vendors. Nearly every network element has its own interface with different transport
    protocols, authentication (if any), encryption (if any), commands etc. This makes
    every new connection highly complicated and costly.\r\nThe interfaces between
    Administration and Mediation Functions are usually proprietary and internally
    within a product for LI and therefore need not be compatible between products
    of different vendors.\r\n\r\nTraditionally X1 and HI1 interfaces have not been
    standardized. Given the experience of standardization in HI2 and HI3 industry
    has received benefits from this by way of interoperability, security and cost
    reduction.\r\n\r\nThis WI does not intend to force compatibility on legacy equipment
    although should that be possible it will be welcomed. An inability by the LEMF
    to support this proposed standard should not allow a fall back to a less secure
    protocol. The initial focus is on newer IP related systems (but not limited to
    IP). However there is no intention to exclude circuit switch or other elements
    from using this output.\r\n\r\nWith a view to the future, as network and services
    become virtualized this WI intends to support newer implementations by ensuring
    a standard interface is available to the provisioning equipment or service.\r\n\r\nThe
    ADMF (provisioning system) translates HI1 messages to X1 and vice versa. It is
    effectively a proxy between the LEA/LEMF and the network operator. This allows
    insulation for the CSP to manage their network as they see fit without untoward
    impact on the LEMF, and vice versa. It also allows for enhanced security management.
    Maintaining this concept is key to this work item.\r\nIt is intended to start
    work with the X1 interface and follow with interfaces X3 and X2.\r\n\r\nScope\r\n1.Alignment
