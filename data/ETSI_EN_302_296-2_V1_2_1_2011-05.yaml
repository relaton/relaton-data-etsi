- content: Correction of some technical errors. For example it dexcribes the application
    of a quasi-peak detector for the measurement of cabinet radiation limits up to
    4.5 GHz, but there is no specification for a QP detector above 1GHz. Furthermore
    there are some other changes that are waiting to be made, such a revision to be
    in line with the new guidelines on harmonized standards.
