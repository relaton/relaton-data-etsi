abstract:
- content: This TR will characterize the performance of LC3plus codec. It will provide
    subjective or objective speech and audio quality test results for relevant modes
    of LC3plus in the range of narrowband to fullband, bitrates between 16 and 320
    kbps and for 2.5, 5 and 10 ms codec frame size at clean and distorted channels.
    Performance for transcoding and tandem coding scenarios relevant for DECT, VoIP
    and other applications will be investigated.The work will be coordinated betweeen
    ETSI DECT and ETSI STQ.
