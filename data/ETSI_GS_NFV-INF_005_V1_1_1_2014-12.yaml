abstract:
- content: The WI specifies an architectural description of the Infrastructure Network
    domain of the virtualisation infrastructure which supports virtualised network
    functions. It sets out the scope of the infrastructure network domain acknowledging
    the potential for overlap between virtualisation infrastructure domains, and between
    the infrastructure networkdomain and the virtualised network functions. Its also
    sets out the nature of interfaces needed between infrastructure domains and within
    the infrastructure network domain.
