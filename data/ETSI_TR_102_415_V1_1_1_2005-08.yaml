  content: "European network operators can expect to experience a significant demand
    from customers for ICT services to support the care of vulnerable people while
    they engage in the activities of everyday life. Supported independence through
    the delivery of care services through public and private networks will give vulnerable
    customers greater access to independent life within the wider community and reduce
    the need for institutional care. \r\nThis work item will provide a technical report
    identifying the key issues and standardisation actions that ETSI TC HF needs to
    take to facilitate the growth of care service delivery to intelligent homes\r\n"
