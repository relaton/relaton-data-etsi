abstract:
- content: "This TBR specifies those technical requirements under Article 4 of\r\nCouncil
    Directive 93/97/EEC [1] that apply to Mobile Earth Station\r\n(MES) equipment
    with both transmit and receive capabilities for\r\noperation in a Satellite -
    Personal Communications Network (S-PCN).\r\n These MESs include handheld, portable
    and vehicle mounted equipment\r\nor may be a component in a multi-mode treminal;
    they may consist of a\r\nnumber of modules with associated connections and user
    interface, or\r\nmay be self contained, single units.\r\nIf the MES is a component
    in a multi-mode terminal, this TBR applies\r\nonly to the MES component of the
    terminal, unless otherwise stated.\r\n The frequency bands within which the MESs
    operate as as follows:\r\n -1980-2010 MHz, (MES transmit)\r\n-2170-2200 MHz (MES
    receive).\r\n The technical requirements in this TBR are in two major categories:\r\n
    unwanted emission: to protect terrestrial and other satellite\r\nradio services
    from harmful interference generated by the MES\r\nin normal use;\r\n MES control
    and monitoring: to speicfy the a minimum set of\r\nControl and Monitoring Functions
    (CMF) that shall be \r\nimplemented in each MES in order to minimise the probability\r\nthat
    they originate unwanted transmissions that may give rise\r\nto harmful interference
    to other systems.\r\n These requirements are taken from ETS 300 734 [3].\r\n Network
    Control Facilities (NCF) for MES networks are defined by\r\nreference to  ETS
    300 735 [2].\r\n This TBR does not contain the essential requirements under articles\r\n4f
    and 4g for interworking via the public telecommunications network,\r\nand does
    not provide any guarantee of correct interworking between\r\nMES equipment.\r\n
    The Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC Articles 4a and 4b are covered by\r\nother Directives
    and therefore, are not covered by this TBR.\r\n"
