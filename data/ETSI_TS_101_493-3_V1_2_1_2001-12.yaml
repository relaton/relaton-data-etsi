abstract:
- content: Specification of a IEEE 1394 service specific sub-layer which provides
    a method of transporting IEEE 1394 isochronous and asynchronous packets as well
    as timing information. The IEEE 1394 SSCS sub-part 1 provides services that are
    generic for any kind of 1394 application. It will use the services of the Packet
    based CPCS. This revision includes all CRs approved until the end of 2000 (BRAN#21).
