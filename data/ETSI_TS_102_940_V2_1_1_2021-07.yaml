abstract:
- content: NWI (19)051008 aims to incorporate appropriate parts of the upcoming IEEE
    1609.2.1 into TS 102 941. Our analysis shows that also architectural aspects may
    be affected by these suiteable parts of IEEE 1609.2.1. TS 102940 shall be opened
    to include optional architectural variants if required by the revised TS 102941
    and to consider additional requirements and corrections on the PKI architecture
    and ITS-S communication security requirements considering the needs of new use
    cases for ITS Release 2 and outcomes from the Revised TVRA.
