abstract:
- content: "To study the possibility of introduction of a separate document containing
    service interactions between all ISDN supplementary services. With the current
    approach, where the interactions are described in the standard of each supplementary
    service concerned, it is hard to keep track of where the latest version of the
    text is located. This trial document will contain the same set of approved supplementary
    services as the latest draft of the respective stage 3 interaction document. For
    this trial period the current approach will kept in parallel, i.e. for the supplemantary
    services currently under work, the interactions are described in the standard
    of each supplemenatry service.\r\n\r\nReference document: EN 300 195-1 V1.4.1/1998-06."
