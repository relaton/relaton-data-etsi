abstract:
- content: "This TBR specifies the technical characteristics (electrical and acoustic
    requirements) under Article 4(g) of Directive 91/263/EEC to\r\nbe provided by
    a single, handset telephony, terminal equipment which is intended:\r\n(a) for
    pan-European approval; and\r\n(b) for connection by 2-wires to an analogue interface
    of a PSTN. This interface is characterised by a d.c. loop to indicate seizure
    and clearing, low frequency a.c.ringing signals below the speech passband to indicate
    an incoming call and in the transmission phase has an approximate bandwidth of
    3 kHz at the network termination point; and\r\n(c) for supporting the voice telephony
    justified case service.\r\nWork Item supported by Nortel, BT, Siemens, CSELT,
