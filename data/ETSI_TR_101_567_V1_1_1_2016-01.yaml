abstract:
- content: "To provide an ETSI Report on requests for handover and delivery of real-time
    information associated with cloud/virtual services.  The Report will identify
    Lawful Interception (LI) and Retained Data (RD) needs and requirements in the
    converged cloud/virtual service environment, the challenges and obstacles of complying
    with those requirements, what implementations can be achieved under existing ETSI
    LI standards, and what new work may be required to achieve needed Lawful Interception
    capabilities. \r\nCloud Services in whichever forms they take (Infrastructure,
    Software, Platform or combinations of these) are often trans border in nature
    and the information required to maintain LI/RD capability or sufficient coverage
    for LI/RD support may vary in different countries, or within platforms of different
    security assurance levels. This work item aims to ensure capabilities can be maintained
    while allowing business to utilise the advantages and innovations of Cloud Services.\r\nIt
    is proposed that this work occur cooperatively with relevant cloud security technical
    bodies (e.g. ITU-T FG CLOUD). \r\n"
