abstract:
- content: "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is mentioned in different ETSI NFV GSs
    (e.g. SWA001 Annex A). A number of POCs also combine NFV with SDN. The deliverable
    for this Work Item (WI) will identify use cases, clarify the different usages
    of SDN within the context of the NFV architecture framework, including SDN Controller
    as a VNF, SDN Controller as a realization of the Infrastructure network controller,
    etc. , and  proposes  requirements to be fulfilled, e.g. by an SDN controller
    playing the role of network controller in the NFV architecture (cf. MAN001 clause
    5.6). \r\nNetwork domains to be covered include datacenter SDN, datacenter-WAN
    interworking, access network and WAN. The WI will also provide a comparison with
    other forms of network controllers.  \r\nThe work item will leverage existing
    work from ETSI ISG NFV. It will support discussions with other SDO and Opensource
    projects such as IETF, OPNFV, ONF, OpenStack, OpenDaylight and others as appropriate.
    The deliverable will contain informative material only but  will also make recommendations
    as to whether normative work should be initiated as a follow-up activity.\r\n"
