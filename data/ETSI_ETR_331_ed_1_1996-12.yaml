abstract:
- content: "The requirements for legal interception (see reference) provide for a\r\nset
    of general requirements for the interception of telecommunications\r\nby law enforcement
    and state security agencies. These requirements\r\nwill be used as a basis for
    the technical work. In their present form,\r\nhowever, they are not suitable for
    immediate implementation in\r\ntelecommunications systems and require transformation
    to technically\r\nuseful statements or requirements prior to standardization.\r\nThis
    transformation process will consist of three steps:\r\nStep 1: Define user requirements\r\nStep
    2: Define network requirements\r\nStep 3: Define handover interface(s)\r\n This
    ETR covers step 1 above.\r\n  "
