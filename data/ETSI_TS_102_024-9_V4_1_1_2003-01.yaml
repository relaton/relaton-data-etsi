abstract:
- content: The present document, "TIPHON call completion performance classification",
    specifies the signalling aspects associated with the control of end-to-end QoS
    within and between TIPHON domains for Voice over IP. It defines call and media
    processing parameters, bounds on the values of these parameters and a possible
    classification system. The specified parameters apply to session and media flow
    set-up and close-down as well as to mid-session changes and include issues of
    signalling accuracy, signalling latency and signalling reliability.
