  content: "EN 301 908 does already cover requirements on repeaters for IMT-2000:
    within 3GPP2 requirements on repeaters for cdma2000 were initially part of the
    minimum performance specifications of base stations. Therefore, such requirements
    were also included into part 5 of EN 301 908 on cdma2000 base stations. As the
    requirements on repeaters for cdma2000 have been refined and expanded significantly
    in 3GPP2, a separate minimum performance specification has been created for cdma2000
    repeaters in 3GPP2 and will be adopted by TIA.\r\nIt is suggested that a separate
    part 12 for cdma2000 repeaters shall be created for EN 301 908. This was already
    approved together with the WI on IMT-2000 repeaters that was approved in December
    2002. However, due to mismatch in anticipated time schedules part 12 has not been
    created yet."
