abstract:
- content: 'The scope for this WI is to specify NORMATIVE rules for how to use the
    Gq'', Rq, Re and Ia protocols as of TISPAN release 2. The usage of these protocols
    between the following functional entities is covered by these rules. : 路P-CSCF
    and SPDF using Gq'' 路IBCF and SPDF using Gq'' 路SPDF x_RACF and RECF using Re and
    (C- and I-) BGF using Ia 路SPDF and A-RACF using Rq In addition, to illustrate
    the usage of these rules INFORMATIVE signalling flows between the above-listed
    entities are within the scope of this WI. Non-IMS AF entities are out of scope
    of this WI. Thus, the rules for using the Gq'', Rq and Ia protocols and the signalling
    flows provided do NOT cover possible signalling scenarios for non-IMS applications.
    They describe however basic principles for how parameters travel via these protocols
    for IMS, which should be considered when using these protocols for non-IMS AF
    entities.'
