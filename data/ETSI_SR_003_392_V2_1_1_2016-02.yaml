abstract:
- content: The CSC phase 1 report provides a list of available standards based on
    a segmentation of the Cloud Computing Service Life-cycle by activities. This segmentation
    will be first adjusted to take into account the results of DMI/NTECH-00030, DMI/NTECH-00031
    and DMI/NTECH-00032. Then, the new deliverables of Cloud Computing standardization
    between Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be collected and the progress of the overall
    maturity of standards will be evaluated.
