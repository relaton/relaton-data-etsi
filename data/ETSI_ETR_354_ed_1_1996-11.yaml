abstract:
- content: "No mandatory protocol between the Service Centre (SC) and the Mobile S\r\nwitching
    Centre (MSC) below the transfer layer is specified by GSM; th\r\nis is a matter
    of agreement between SC and PLMN operators.\r\nThis ETSI Technical Report (ETR)
    specifies three approaches to the spe\r\ncification of protocol stacks of communication
    protocols for the purpo\r\nse of relaying short messages and alerts between Short
    Message Service\r\nCentres and Gateway/Interworking MSCs (GMSC) for the Short
    Message Se\r\nrvice (SMS). One approach is based upon use of the complete OSI
    refere\r\nnce model (see X.200), another approach is based upon the use of only\r\nthe
    lower three OSI layers, and another approach is based upon the use\r\nof CCITT
    Signalling System No. 7 (see Q.700).\r\nAlternative protocol stacks are specified
    via ASN.1 encoding rules (se\r\ne X.208 and X.209). These alternative protocol
    stacks are examples for\r\nthe implementation of the Short Message Relay Layer
    (SM-RL). The requ\r\nirements placed upon the Short Message Relay Layer are briefly
    describ\r\ned in clause 9 of GSM 03.40.\r\nSpecifications are based upon individual
    contributions. Any judgement\r\nconcerning functionality, completeness and advantages/disadvantages
    of\r\nimplementation is intentionally omitted.\r\n  "
