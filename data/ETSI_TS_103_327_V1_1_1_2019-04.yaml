abstract:
- content: The present document gives the high level description of infrastructure
    and mechanisms providing solutions for heterogeneity management in Smart BANs.
    The scope will mainly cover the networking level up to the service and application
    level. The expected solutions will mainly concern the description and the specification
    of a standardized infrastructure for Smart BAN entities (e.g. sensors, actuators)
    interactions, data access and monitoring, irrespective of whatever lower layers
    and radio technologies are used underneath. . Finally, on the service and application
    side, standardized APIs for secure interaction and access to SmartBAN data/entities
    (data transfer and sharing mechanisms included) will be addressed (e.g. PN inspired,
    web based, XaaS).
