abstract:
- content: The work item aims to catalogue security features in management software
    relevant to NFV. It covers OpenStack as the first case study. The initial deliverable
    is a catalogue of OpenStack modules that provide security services (such as authentication,
    authorization, confidentiality, integrity protection, logging, and auditing) with
    the full graphs of their respective dependencies down to the modules that implement
    cryptographic protocols and algorithms.  Once the dependency graph is established,
    recommendations could be made on which options are appropriate for NFV deployment.
