  content: "SUBJECT\r\n In VBS it is optional to perform authentication immediately
    at call establishment to speed-up the call establishment. Authentication may be
    delayed, but always has to be performed.\r\nThe specification does not clearly
    describe what action to take if the MS active in an VBS is leaving the VBS area.\r\n"
