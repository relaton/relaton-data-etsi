abstract:
- content: "The present document revises GR ENI 010 to further: (1) investigate quantitative
    evaluation criteria of network autonomicity categories, (2) perform a deeper research
    of more quantitative factors that determine those categories, (3) define an accurate
    scoring criteria that complies with the evolution of the ENI architecture and
    (4) define a data model covering an entire operator's network or just a specific
    domain.\r\nThis deeper research will be complemented by the description of several
    example scenarios where the quantitative factors and the scoring evaluation criteria
    will be illustrated. This can be done by analysing the relationship among network
    KPIs of different levels, e.g. between the network infrastructure capabilities
    and the network intelligence levels."
