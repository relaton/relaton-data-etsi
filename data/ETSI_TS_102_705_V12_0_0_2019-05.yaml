  content: " The present document describes the UICC Application Programming Interface
    for Java Card for contactless Applications. Its purpose is to provide access for
    a contactless Applet to the services provided by the HCI protocol defined in [4]
    for the communication via the CLF. In the scope of the present document contactless
    means support for the RF Technologies referenced by the HCI specification [4].
    Low level functionality to manage gates and pipes as defined in the HCI specification
    [4] is not in the scope of the present document. \r\n"
