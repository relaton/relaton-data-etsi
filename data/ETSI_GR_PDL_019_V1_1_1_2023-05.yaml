    and trust service management. The scope of the work includes objective(s) to analyse
    and identify required PDL framework services related to aspects such as (i) DID
    and trust service management; (ii) to support DID for end devices and end-users
    as applicable; (iii) to achieve controlled transparency to share trust data with
    service providers; and (iv) to support co-operation with APIs related to public
    services (e.g., eIDAS framework and EBSI services) and private services.
