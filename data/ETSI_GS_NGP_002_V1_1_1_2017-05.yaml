abstract:
- content: This work item focuses on making network self-organizing, both control
    plane and management plane. The self-organizing characteristics include self-configuration,
    self-optimization, self-protection, self-healing, and self-learning, etc. The
    aim is to make the network be able to adapt to unpredictable changes while hiding
    intrinsic complexity from operators and users. Both protocol-oriented close-loop
    mechanisms and machine learning mechanisms, which may also require support by
    new protocols, are in the scope of technical proposals.
