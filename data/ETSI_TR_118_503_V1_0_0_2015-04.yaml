abstract:
- content: "The present document provides an evaluation of existing M2M-related Architecture
    work undertaken by the founding partners of oneM2M, including: the Association
    of Radio Industries and Businesses (ARIB) and the Telecommunication Technology
    Committee (TTC) of Japan; the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions
    (ATIS) and the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) of the USA; the China
    Communications Standards Association (CCSA); the European Telecommunications Standards
    Institute (ETSI); and the Telecommunications Technology Association (TTA) of Korea.
    \ Common Functional Entities and Reference Points are identified, as well as critical
    differences.  New functionality will not be considered as part of this study.\r\nThe
    present document is intended to ensure a common understanding of existing M2M
    Architectural approaches, in order to facilitate future normative work resulting
    in oneM2M Technical Specifications.\r\n"
