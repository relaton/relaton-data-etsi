  content: "\r\nThe goal of this task is to produce generic security specifications
    for QKD systems. Based on a thorough security analysis, the steps foreseen in
    the Common Criteria ISO/EN 15408 standard shall be carried out. These are the
    definition of security objectives and underlying functional security requirements.
    The specifications developed in the work item are not directly related to a specific
    implementation of a QKD link, or a specific QKD technology employed. QKD system
    developers will be enabled to develop and specify their systems in concordance
    with this generic QKD security specification as a prerequisite for security evaluation
    and accreditation of their systems for qualified use.\r\n"
