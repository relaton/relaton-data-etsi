  content: " Test purposes play an essential role in test specification processes
    at ETSI. Currently, test purposes are specified in TPLan or TPLan-like notations,
    whereas TDL treats test purposes, and test objectives in general as informal text
    without any additional structural constraints. TC MTS sees TDL as an opportunity
    to integrate and unify the means for the specification of test purposes and test
    descriptions, while relying on the same underlying meta-model and benefiting from
    other related technologies built around this meta-model.\r\n\r\nThis extension
    package for TDL defines means for the refined and formalised test objective specification
    within TDL by incorporating concepts and a syntactical notation related to TPLan.
    Activities in this work item will include the definition of abstract syntax and
    semantics extensions for TDL, as well as a concrete syntax covering these extensions.
    Future work may pursue activities towards guidelines for realising test objectives
    in test descriptions and validation constraints for ensuring consistency between
    test descriptions and realised test objectives.\r\n"
