abstract:
- content: "The work item will investigate the aspects of NFV that have an impact
    on power consumption and energy efficiency, such as:\r\n- the design and runtime
    characteristics of the NFV framework, including VNF, NFVI, NFV-MANO, etc. which
    can influence energy consumption.\r\n- the deployment configuration of NFV-MANO
    systems and their optimization in various scenarios such as small footprint but
    highly distributed deployments, and\r\n- the mechanisms that can enable smart
    energy usage and decision making in NFV considering NFV capabilities such as orchestration
    and automation.\r\nThe work item will identify and provide recommendations for
    normative and/or other informative work. The work item is expected to leverage
    the work done in relevant organizations such as ETSI EE and 3GPP. The resulting
    deliverable will be informative."
