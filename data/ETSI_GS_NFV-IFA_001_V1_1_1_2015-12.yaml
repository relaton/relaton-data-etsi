abstract:
- content: "This WI suggests a common architecture and abstraction layer for the NFV
    acceleration (hardware & software), which allows deployment of various accelerators
    within NFVI and facilitates interoperability between various VNFs and accelerators.
    As well as presenting the general overview of the NFV acceleration, this WI also
    describes a set of use cases illustrating the usage of NFV acceleration in NFV
    environment.  \r\n\r\nThe deliverable will contain informative material only.
    \ This Work Item is the 1st of a series of Work Items on NFV Acceleration. Its
    deliverable will be the 1st part of a multi-part Group Specification.  "
