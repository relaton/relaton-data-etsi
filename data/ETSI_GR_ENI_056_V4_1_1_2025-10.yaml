  content: The present document studies multi-agent systems (MASs), which comprise
    multiple artificial intelligence (AI) agents designed to solve a set of complex
    tasks collaboratively. It reviews popular existing open-source frameworks to implement
    MASs and existing multi-agent topologies, conversation patterns and key design
    principles. This includes interface design for collaborative inference, key performance
    indicators to quantify the performance of MASs, as well as various workflow options
    to perform closed-loop optimization between AI agents. While focusing primarily
    on the employment of MASs in the next generation mobile networks, the present
    document explicitly discusses recommended architectural changes in the design
    principles of core network together with potential standard impacts.
