abstract:
- content: "The quantum threat presents multiple high impact risks for the industry
    and its users. The consequences are important to stakeholders as they may lead
    to privacy breach, network disruption or other impacts with significant implications.\r\nIt
    is expected that the security mechanisms defined in specifications under ETSI
    TC SET responsibility, based on cryptography, are at risk to  be broken by a sufficiently
    powerful quantum computer within a foreseeable timeframe:\r\n-\twhere asymmetric
    cryptography is used, both confidentiality and authenticity of the communications
    will be compromised.\r\n-\tsymmetric cryptography will also be impacted but to
    a smaller extent as a moderate increase of the key length should be sufficient
    to withstand attacks using quantum computing.\r\n(For more information see the
    document SET(23)000065r1)\r\nRemediation thus cannot wait for the realization
    of a sufficiently powerful quantum computer.\r\nTherefore, ETSI TC SET needs to
    \ analyse the impacts of the post-quantum computing. \r\nThe work is expected
    to produce a technical report that addresses the following:\r\n-\tAnalysis of
    the mechanisms that use cryptography in specifications under ETSI SET responsibility
    focused on the risks described above.\r\n-\tDescription of potential changes to
    adapt the existing mechanisms to be post-quantum safe. For example, the impact
    on performances may be considered and may lead to the adaptation of the current
    mechanisms.\r\n-\tLiaison with relevant ETSI bodies (TC CYBER WG QSC and ISG QKD)
    and partner organizations (e.g., 3GPP, GlobalPlatform, GSMA) for coordination
    purpose and to estimate a roadmap for the update of the specifications under ETSI
    TC SET responsibility, with consideration to the items to be prioritized.\r\n"
