  content: The Technical Report is a study on how to establish an interworking framework
    and functions of DECT with 3GPP networks. The study will analyze existing possibilities
    in 3GPP and DECT technical specifications and will derive possible approaches,
    system architectures and functions to enable trusted and non-trusted interworking.
