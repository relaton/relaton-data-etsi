abstract:
- content: "The present document defines a platform-independent environment, where
    executable applications can be signalled, transferred to receivers, and executed.\r\nThe
    present document defines formats of file resources relevant to the applications,
    protocols for downloading applications, ways to designate resources on broadcast
    networks from the applications, the signalling of the downloaded applications,
    and detailed interfaces among receiver platform, broadcast and communication networks,
    and the applications.\r\nIn combination with platform specific parts of this standard,
    a complete definition of the environment for applications is produced."
