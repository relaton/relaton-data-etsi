abstract:
- content: "This work item  provides guidelines for test plans that assess different
    approaches to defining SDN Applications, different ways of arranging and federating
    SDN Controllers, and arrangements of network switching/forwarding functions (both
    physical and virtual) to create the various path-implementations between and among
    NS Endpoints and VNFs.\r\nThese guidelines support development of detailed test
    plans, and ultimately influence the NFV framework (when testers  share their results
    from testing arrangements encouraged by these guidelines).\r\nThe test plan guidelines
    should be sufficiently abstract to include all envisioned possibilities, and will
    also pursue the details of technologies of interest.\r\nAlthough the primary emphasis
    of testing is the performance and benchmarking of systems composed of the components
    above, the attempts to combine different protocols and functions will undoubtedly
    uncover combinations which are non-interoperable, and these should be noted.  (See
    NFV(15)FTR011r2 for more information, including SDOs/areas of collaboration outside
    this scope.)"
