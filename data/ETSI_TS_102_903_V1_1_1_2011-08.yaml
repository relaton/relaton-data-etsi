  content: "The present document reports on the practical evaluation, demonstrations
    and certification procedures for the mitigation mechanisms for RFID systems operating
    in the band between 915MHz to 921MHz. The active mechanisms covered in this Technical
    Specification are intended to mitigate against any harmful interference generated
    by RFID interrogators towards ER-GSM terminals operated in the band between 918MHz
    to 921MHz. \r\nThe present document does not cover the location based methods,
    nor does it include RFID tags operating in the band with a power levels up to
    -10dBm."
