abstract:
- content: "This standard will describe the technical solutions for measuring:\r\n(a)
    resistance to accidental drops;\r\n(b) scratch resistance;\r\n(c) protection from
    dust and water;\r\n(d) protection from accidental spills;\r\n(e) battery endurance
    in cycles;\r\n(f) rated capacity of the battery;\r\n(g) contact closure cycle
    resistance;\r\n(h) insertion/extraction cycle resistance.\r\n\r\nStandard will
    describe, at least, the apparatus to be used, the necessary steps and conditions
    to test the resistance to accidental drops, the determined defect(s) and the information
    to be given in the test report for each tested unit.\r\n\r\nStandard will describe
