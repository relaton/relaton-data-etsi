abstract:
- content: The present document defines testing methodologies to be used for modern
    mobile terminals in the presence of background noise. The testing methodology
    is based on EG 202 396-3. This revision is to indicate that the performance of
    certain wideband terminals, featuring AI-based speech enhancement techniques developed
    after training and validation of the model as completed, may not be accurately
    indicated by this model.
