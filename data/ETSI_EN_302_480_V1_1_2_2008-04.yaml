abstract:
- content: "To develop an ETSI candidate harmonised standard for the onboard aircraft
    GSM system. The candidate harmonised standard shall outline the essential requirements
    according to article 3.2 of the R&TTE directive for the system. \r\nThe GSM onboard
    system provides GSM access in the 1800 MHz band while inhibiting direct connectivity
    between onboard mobiles and terrestrial cellular networks. \r\nThe system will
    use elements from existing relevant harmonised standards (EN 301 502) where appropriate.\r\nNote:
    that the study does not include the airworthiness regulations, operational aspects
    or compatibility with the aircraft avionics."
