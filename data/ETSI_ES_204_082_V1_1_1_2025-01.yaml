abstract:
- content: "This work relates and builds on and complements the DTS/EE-EEPS55 (TS
    103 881) work item that defines requirements for a global digital sustainable
    product passport/information (and any information items there will be moved to
    this work item).\r\nThis proposed new work item aims at the definition of an information
    model for the description of details about ICT products, with a focus on the environment:
    circularity, environmental sustainability, and human health. This work will determine
    the information items, to be represented in digital format, about ICT product
    information, either as individual products or grouped by model, batch, etc. common
    to all ICT products or specific to certain product categories. The information
    details can represent products at any time of their circular lifespan: design,
    manufacturing, through the usage phases and changes over the lifespan, until final
    recycling as e-waste.\r\nAn information model can help inform relevant actors
    involved with ICT products. \r\nThe goal of the recommendation is to define the
    semantics required to represent the relevant information in a feasible digital
    form, related and building on existing digital data formats, linked data, and
    data system architectures, as well as relate to and complement upcoming regional
    (e.g. European digital product passport) and global (ISO PCDS, IEC 82474-1) standards.\r\nThis
    recommendation relates to and builds on other ITU-T recommendations and work items,
    such as the L.1023 recommendation on an assessment method for circular scoring
    that can translate into information items. It can facilitate the calculation of
    environmental impacts of different ICT products according to ES 203 1999 and ITU-T
    L.1400-1451, and mobile phones according to L.1015. \r\n.\r\nThis will be a TA
    with ITU-T L.D4PI "
