abstract:
- content: "Connection based Virtual  Services are  provided over connections between
    a service user and applications hosted by a data center in the cloud (e.g. Virtual
    Services defined by MEF).\r\nThis Work Item will:\r\n- Describe use cases and
    \ identify gaps within the NFV Architecture Framework to support connection-based
    Virtual Services;\r\n- Identify recommendations for interfaces of service user
    and virtual resources ( e.g. VM, Containers),  and interfaces between Cloud Service
    Providers(cSPs) , including the interface  between Telco and cSP,  to support
    the virtual services ; \r\n- Identify recommendations for connection and connection
    end  points to support the virtual services.\r\n\r\nNote that the NFV Charging
    capabilities within EVE-008 and NFV Security capabilities within IFA 026, NFV
    Multi Domain within IFA-028 and NFV Multisite within IFA-022 may be applied to
    work of  this Work Item."
