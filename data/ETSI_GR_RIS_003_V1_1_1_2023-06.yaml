abstract:
- content: This work item is intended to study (i) communication models that strike
    a suitable trade-off between electromagnetic accuracy and simplicity for performance
    evaluation and optimization, (ii) channel models that include path-loss and multipath
    propagation effects, as well as the impact of interference, and (iii) key performance
    indicators and the methodology for evaluating the performance of RISs for application
    to wireless communications, including the coexistence between different network
    operators, and for fairly comparing different transmission techniques, communication
    protocols, and network deployments.
