  content: "Combined GSM and MobileIP Handling in UMTS IP CN, phase 1 and 2\r\nThis
    WI will prepare a technical report studying the feasibility of evolving the GPRS
    backbone for UMTS to use more standard IP solutions.  An initial assumption is
    a scenario with a combination of GSM/GPRS mobility management and Mobile IP .
    \r\nThe output of this study will contain \r\nIdentification of the requirements
    for supporting IP services and network interconnect in UMTS.\r\nA UMTS CN architecture
    based on components from GSM/GPRS as well as IP and Mobile IP (IPv4 and IPv6).\r\nA
    comparison of such an architecture with the current GPRS backbone architecture
    regarding performance, security, alignment with fixed IP networks and services
    \ etc. \r\nAn analysis of  the dependence of the development in IETF.\r\nA discussion
    on the compatibility with earlier phases of GPRS\r\nJustification\r\nThe UMTS
    core network has been identified to evolve from the GSM core network. Further
    it is envisaged that the basis for mobility handling in a UMTS network will rely
    on the mobility services already provided by GSM2+ and on possible expansions
    of these. For providing IP services, an evolved GPRS architecture could be deployed.
    However, due to recent increased popularity in IP technology, there is some concern
    that the current GPRS structure might not be the optimal one for UMTS. Therefore
    it is of importance to study how UMTS could be better aligned with future development
    of IP networks, while reusing as much as possible of the already existing GSM
    infrastructure..\r\n\r\nIn order to provide roaming, and possibly handover, between
    radio access networks, the use of Mobile IP as a complement to GSM/GPRS mobility
    handling should be investigated. In a combination scenario, where an IP network
    is used in the core network, Mobile IP could be used to handle discrete mobility
    between access networks, i.e. roaming(and perhaps handover) between radio access
    networks (UTRANs), while GSM/GPRS could be used for handling subscriber data,
    charging mechanisms, security issues, etc., The GPRS SGSN node -enhanced with
    some IP functionality -  could be used for mechanisms such as authorization and
    handling of encryption keys.\r\n\r\nThis work item addresses a study on the enhancements
    needed to enable combined use of mobility handling systems, i.e. adoptions in
    terms of interfaces and functionality needed in the mobile terminal and in GSNs,
    as well as the combined use of home agents (HA) and HLRs.\r\n\r\n\r\nService Aspects\r\nThis
    work item aims at studying roaming, including handover, between UTRANs and to
    provide and facilitate direct Internet and intranet access from the mobile terminal.
    \r\n\r\nMMI-Aspects\r\nTo be identified\r\n\r\nCharging Aspects\r\nThe use of
    GPRS charging mechanisms in an IP environment will be addressed.\r\n\r\nSecurity
    Aspects\r\n. Security issues related to the use of IPsec will be included in the
    study. \r\n"
