abstract:
- content: "To produce guidelines that reflect user-oriented addressing requirements
    of users of telecommunications systems. They would express implementation free
    addressing capabilities that future systems would need in order to enable users
    to locate users or services in ways that are natural and meaningful to them. The
    guidelines would be used by authors of ETSI standards to ensure that user's addressing
    needs are met by systems that follow their standards.\r\n"
