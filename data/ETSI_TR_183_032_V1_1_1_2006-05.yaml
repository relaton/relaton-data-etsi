abstract:
- content: To address issues for the support of ISUP information between IMS entities,
    i.e. MGCF to MGCF, MGCF to AS, AS to MGCF, AGCF to AS, and possibly AS to AS.
    To provide a home for text for incorporation into other deliverables (e.g. DES/TISPAN-03019,
    DES/TISPAN-03053) once the documentation structure has been decided. The TR should
    consider existing mechanisms like SIP or NSS and other possibilities like the
    encapsulation of a “XML-ISUP”. A number of potential use cases exist for such
    a mechanism, e.g. PSTN to PSTN bridging using IMS, support of service information
    to AS from MGCF in simulation services, support of the IMS based PSTN/ISDN emulation
    subsystem, but it is not in the scope of this TR to document information relating
    to use of this mechanism to support such use cases (e.g. DTS/TISPAN-03044). Such
    use of this mechanism will be dealt with by other work items, This work is intended
    for release 1, but a decision on incorporation in release 1 will depend on progress
