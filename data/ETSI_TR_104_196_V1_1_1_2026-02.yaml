abstract:
- content: The present document describes considerations for situations in which providers
    choose to adopt web-based portal solutions to respond to requests from Authorized
    Organizations. The present document describes portals and explains how existing
    ETSI TC LI specifications can be used to improve Portal design. The present document
    shows how Portals can become a stepping stone towards adoption of interfaces defined
    by an ETSI TC LI Technical Specification. The present document highlights some
    caveats around Portals and makes it clear that Portals are not a substitute for
    meeting ETSI TC LI Technical Specifications.
