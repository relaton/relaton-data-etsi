abstract:
- content: "The use of IoT devices by users to abuse and coerce vulnerable users is
    a matter that ETSI cannot ignore. The number, and format, of devices, their penetration,
    and their core functionality, all make them attractive to both the vulnerable
    user and their abuser. The intent of this work item is to identify design practices
    that guide the development of measures that allow some degree of mitigation in
    both the devices themselves and in the services that the devices support.\r\n\r\nThread
    #1: Coercive control resistant design\r\n\r\nThe role of coercive control resistant
    design is addressed in device and service design. It is expected that this will
    examine and guide the designer on the roles of user identification, location and
    access control, in order to limit, where possible, the ability of the abusive
    or coercive party to use the device whilst not limiting the access to the device
    functionality by the intended user.\r\n\r\nThread #2: Trauma informed design\r\n\r\nTrauma
    informed design requires acceptance that devices are actively targeted as threat-agents
    of coercion. This element of the work is expected to address feature extensions
    in IoT devices and services to allow the at risk user to seek help without interference
    from the coercive party. The work should also identify where future standards
    are required to further strengthen the protection of the vulnerable user."
