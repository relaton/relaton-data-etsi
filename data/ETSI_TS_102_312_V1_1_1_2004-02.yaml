abstract:
- content: "This Standard specifies the communication mode selection mechanism, designed
    to not disturb any ongoing communication at 13,56MHz, for devices implementing
    Ecma-340 and the reader functionality for integrated circuit cards compliant to
    ISO/IEC 14443 or ISO/IEC 15693. This standard mandates that conforming implementations
    enter the selected communication mode as specified in the respective standard.
    The communication mode specifications, however, are outside the scope of this
    NFCIP-2 Standard. \r\nEcma-340, ISO/IEC 14443 and ISO/IEC 15693 standards specify
    the RF signal interface, initialisation, anticollision and protocols for wireless
    interconnection of closely coupled devices and access to contactless integrated
    circuit cards operating at 13,56MHz.\r\n"
