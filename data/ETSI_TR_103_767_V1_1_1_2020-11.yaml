abstract:
- content: The present document provides a high-level description of a process for
    interfacing between law enforcement and providers of vehicle information. The
    present document is not a legal document and does not state when or whether such
    an interface should be used. Instead, the present document highlights that (whenever
    there is a lawful requirement to deliver information) it is beneficial to use
    an automated, secure, efficient interface. The present document investigates to
    what extent the existing TC LI specifications can be used for such an interface.  The
    present document does not specify any details of such an interface; the interface
    design would need to be done in conjunction with a cross-section of the relevant
    industries.
