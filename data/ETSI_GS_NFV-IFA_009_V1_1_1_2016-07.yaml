abstract:
- content: "The WI is an architecture study that shall: \r\n•\toutline clearly a set
    of possible functional/architectural options\r\n•\tanalyse the impact of different
    interactions between some functional blocks in the NFV architectural framework
    (EM, VNF, OSS) and NFV-MANO functional blocks (NFVO, VNFM, VIM) on the functional
    partitioning/distribution/consolidation of functionality amongst NFV-MANO functional
    blocks\r\n•\tanalyse the scope of the VNFM and NFVO and clarify the difference
    and impact, if any,  of separating VNFM from the NFVO versus having those functionalities
    combined\r\n•\tanalyse the impact of centralized versus distributed VNFM functionality\r\n•\tanalyze
    and outline functional/architectural impact of separating versus combining the
    two broad functions of the NFVO (Network Service Orchestration and Resource Orchestration);
    \r\n•\tanalyze and outline functional/architectural options of VNFM, NFVO, VIM
    to support operations across administrative domains boundaries and identify the
    necessary interfaces.\r\n•\tidentify for each architectural option views of usage
    of the interfaces and functional blocks, and which management interfaces are significant\r\n•\tprovide
    valuable insights for consideration by other normative work on NFV architecture
    and interfaces\r\n The WI deliverable shall be informative.\r\n"
