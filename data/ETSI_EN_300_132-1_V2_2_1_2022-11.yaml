abstract:
- content: "The following items will be considered in this revision:\r\n- Defined
    the power frequency covered by this standard\r\n- Revise the voltage variation
    requirements for wide voltage range because the present publication does not reflect
    the real power sources\r\n- Clarify the test bench to measure the inrush current\r\nFurthermore,
    other items that maybe raised during this revision will be addressed but the NWI
    scope will be revised to reflect the items under revision"
