abstract:
- content: "This ETR specifies the standardization programme to be executed by\r\nETSI
    and CENELEC with the objective of developing harmonized EMC\r\nstandards for telecommunications
    equipment/installations/networks,\r\nsatellite earth station equipment and radiocommunications
    equipment.\r\nThis ETR has been produced in response to, and to satisfy, the mandate\r\nBC-T-319
    to develop a coherent work programme for the establishment\r\nof harmonized standards
    laying down technical specifications related\r\nto electromagnetic compatibility.
    These technical specifications will\r\nbe the co-ordinated technical elaboration
    of the essential requirement\r\nrelated to EMC of Directives EMC/Terminal/Satellite,
    whichever are\r\nrelevant for the equipment concerned.\r\nThe harmonized European
    standards (harmonized ETSs and ENs), developed\r\nin accordance with this programme
    or future extension(s) thereof, may\r\n-after their reference has been published
    in the CE Official Journal-\r\nbe used to demonstrate presumption of conformance
    with the essential\r\nrequirements related to electromagnetic compatibility of
    the above\r\nDirectives, whichever are relevant for the equipment concerned.\r\nThe
    harmonized standards which are to be developed under the terms\r\nof this programme
    will consist of:\r\n- new standards;\r\n- re-issue of already existing standards,
    amended where necessary to\r\ncover the essential requirements of the Directives
    related to EMC;\r\n- a combination of the two above.\r\n "
