abstract:
- content: "This specification defines a core set of features that enable multiple
    subscriber devices to gain access to operator provided high-speed data service
    using DOCSIS. This core set of features allows for both IPv4- and IPv6-enabled
    devices to gain connectivity to the Internet.\r\nThe eRouter is specified as an
    Embedded Service/Application Functional Entity (eSAFE) device that is implemented
    in conjunction with a DOCSIS cable modem device.\r\nThe core set of features defined
    in this specification includes the ability to provision multiple CPE devices,
    a description of how to forward data to and from CPE devices, and also the ability
    to forward IP Multicast traffic to CPE devices."
