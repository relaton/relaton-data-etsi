  content: "Version 1.3.1 contains further enhancements to be used in the CEN approval
    process.\r\nTS101206-3 version 1.1.1 is the handover version to CENfor becoming
    EN726-3.\r\nPTS has used version 1.2.1 rather than the handover version to CEN(version
    1.1.1) for producing the conformance testing specification for EN726-3 (prEN13343/4/5).\r\nThe
    present version is a further update approved by PTS based on Change Requests.\r\nETSIhas
    produced a set of TSs which are not a copy of any CENpublished EN. The TSs are
    complete and consistent documents with references among themselves. It has been
    made clear in these TSs that they are contributions to the CENwork for publication
    as EN(after re-editing the references). Once published by CENas EN, ETSI will
    withdraw its TSs."
