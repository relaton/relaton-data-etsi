abstract:
- content: "Version 1.3.1 contains further enhancements to be used in the CEN approval
    process.\r\nTS 101 206-3 version 1.1.1 is the handover version to CEN for becoming
    EN 726-3.\r\nPTS has used version 1.2.1 rather than the handover version to CEN (version
    1.1.1) for producing the conformance testing specification for EN 726-3 (prEN13343/4/5).\r\nThe
    present version is a further update approved by PTS based on Change Requests.\r\nETSI has
    produced a set of TSs which are not a copy of any CEN published EN. The TSs are
    complete and consistent documents with references among themselves. It has been
    made clear in these TSs that they are contributions to the CEN work for publication
    as EN (after re-editing the references). Once published by CEN as EN, ETSI will
    withdraw its TSs."
