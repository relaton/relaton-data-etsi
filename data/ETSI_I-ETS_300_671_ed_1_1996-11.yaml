abstract:
- content: "This Interim European Telecommunication Standard I-ETS specifies\r\nrequirements
    of the connector set to be used in single-mode optical\r\nfibres telecommunication
    systems; the scope covers establishment of\r\nuniform requirements for the following
    aspects:\r\n -\toptical, environmental and mechanical properties;\r\n-\ttest conditions;\r\n-\tacceptance
    criteria.\r\n Some users may have additional specific requirements, such as a
    need\r\nto verify perfprmance at lower temperatures. These users should\r\nspecify
    connectors conforming to the basic ETSI performance standard,\r\nplus additional
    tests or more severe test conditions.\r\n Connectors for different applications
    which fall within the scope of\r\nthis I-ETS have common environmental and mechanical
    stability\r\nrequirements, but there are two grades of attenuation requirements
    and\r\nfour grades of return loss. The attenuation grades are designated P\r\nand
    Q. The return loss grades are designated S, T, U and V.\r\n A connector set is
    defined as: \"The complete set of connector\r\ncomponents require to provide demountable
    coupling between one or more\r\npairs of optical fibre.\" The lenght of fibre
    or cable on each side of\r\nthe connector shall be 1,5 metres (minimum). A minimum
    lenght of 1,5 m\r\non each side of the test set must be exposed to the test conditions
    of\r\nall climats and environmental test.\r\n "
