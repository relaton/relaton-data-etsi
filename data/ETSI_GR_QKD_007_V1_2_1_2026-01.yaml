  content: "The present document collects together definitions and abbreviations used
    in relation to Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and ETSI ISG-QKD documents.  QKD
    introduces new concepts and technologies to the field of telecommunications and
    considerable related vocabulary.   Many terms derive from the wider fields of
    quantum physics and classical cryptography but in some cases terms assume a modified
    or more specific meaning when applied to QKD.\r\nThis revision updates terms and
    abbreviations.\r\nThe main objectives of the present document are:\r\nto improve
    the consistency with which terminology and abbreviations are used within ISG-QKD
    documents;\r\nto provide a reference document to reduce confusion by readers who
    may not be familiar with QKD.\r\nMost definitions and abbreviations come from
    ISG-QKD Group Specifications and Group Reports or are expected to be used in published
    documents.  The terms included have been selected to focus the present document
    on those that are expected to be of widespread use or where consistency is felt
    to be particularly important, e.g. due to a specific risk of confusion.  Terms
    introduced in a single ISG-QKD document for a specific purpose that is local to
    that document are excluded unless of particular importance."
