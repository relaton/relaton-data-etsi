abstract:
- content: "This Work Item (WI) will focus on the three fields identified in the justification
    (above):\r\n·Detailed design of authorization architecture: This WI will investigate
    the interfaces among these components (e.g. procedures and parameters), how these
    components could be distributed in different oneM2M entities (i.e. different CSEs),
    and how to use roles (e.g. Service subscription roles). This WI will also consider
    how the authorization architecture accommodates the issues raised by the WI-00xx
    (Dynamic Authorization for IoT).\r\n·Supporting user specified access control
    policies: This WI will investigate how the oneM2M authorization system could be
    an extensible system that can support user-defined access control mechanisms and/or
    access control policy languages.\r\n·Investigating existing access control policy
    languages: This WI will investigate if these access control policy languages could
    be adopted and used in oneM2M authorization system.\r\nThis work item shall produce
    a technical report that provides candidate security solutions related to authorization
    architecture, authorization procedures and access control policies.\r\n"
