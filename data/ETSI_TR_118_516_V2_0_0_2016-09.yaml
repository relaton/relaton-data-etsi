  content: "This Work Item (WI) will focus on the three fields identified in the justification
    (above):\r\nDetailed design of authorization architecture: This WI will investigate
    the interfaces among these components (e.g. procedures and parameters), how these
    components could be distributed in different oneM2M entities (i.e. different CSEs),
    and how to use roles (e.g. Service subscription roles). This WI will also consider
    how the authorization architecture accommodates the issues raised by the WI-00xx
    (Dynamic Authorization for IoT).\r\nSupporting user specified access control policies:
    This WI will investigate how the oneM2M authorization system could be an extensible
    system that can support user-defined access control mechanisms and/or access control
    policy languages.\r\nInvestigating existing access control policy languages: This
    WI will investigate if these access control policy languages could be adopted
    and used in oneM2M authorization system.\r\nThis work item shall produce a technical
    report that provides candidate security solutions related to authorization architecture,
    authorization procedures and access control policies.\r\n"
