  content: "The aim of this work item is the re-publication of the GS NFV-MAN001 as
    a Group Report (GR). \r\nThis re-publication of MAN001 as an informative ETSI
    Group Report aims at keeping its historical content while acknowledging that 6
    years after its first publication, part of it has become obsolete.\r\nFor this
    purpose, all normative provisions (requirements and normative  references) will
    be changed to non-normative,  an introductory text will warn the reader on the
    obsolescence of the content and pointers to more recent ISG NFV normative specifications
    will be added.\r\nNo other technical changes in the content will be performed."
