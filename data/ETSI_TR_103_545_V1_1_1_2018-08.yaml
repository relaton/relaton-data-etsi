  content: The objective of this TR is to provide the necessary input for a Plugtest
    event to validate the possible cooperation between the oneM2M platform and AEF
    ISOBUS standards implemented between a tractor and its implement (an implement
    is a machine usually trailed behind the tractor and performing a specific agricultural
    task). The use case would include a tractor entering a road from the fields. The
    collaboration of Agri IoT and the oneM2M platform would enable to trigger the
    transmission of an alarm to the cars on the road. ETSI TC ITS standards, such
    as EN 302 637-3 (Decentralized Environmental Notification Basic Service) are also
    expected to be part of this cooperation in the use case to be demonstrated.
