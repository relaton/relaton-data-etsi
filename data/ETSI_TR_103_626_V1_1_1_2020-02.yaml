abstract:
- content: The Work Item will provide a mapping and evaluation of architectural components
    for autonomic network management & control developed/implemented in the EC-funded
    WISHFUL Project to the ETSI AFI Generic Autonomic Networking Architecture (GANA)
    modelâ€”an architectural reference model for autonomic networking, cognitive networking
    and self-management. The mapping pertains to architectural components for autonomic
    decision-making and associated control-loops in wireless network architectures
    and their associated management and control architectures.
