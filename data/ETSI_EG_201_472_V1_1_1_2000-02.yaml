    techniques, summarizing all the new methods appeared since the publication of
    ETR 095, and  update all the  information in ETR 095.\r\nTo provide directly usable
    material for the evaluation of a range of telecommunications services: for instance,
    questions which could be used in questionnaires, and which have been tested to
    be useful in different trials.\r\nReference documents:ETR 095, ISO 13407.\r\n"
