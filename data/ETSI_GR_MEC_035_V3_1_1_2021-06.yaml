abstract:
- content: This work item will study the applicability of MEC specifications to inter-MEC
    systems and MEC-Cloud systems coordination that supports e.g., application instance
    relocation, synchronization, and similar functionalities. It will also consider
    enablement and/or enhancement of  functionalities for application lifecycle management
    by third parties (e.g. application developers). Firstly, we will analyse the current
    specifications. Secondly, we will document the use cases that require inter-system
    communication, including those in multi-MNO environments. Thirdly, we will clarify
    the requirements and any missing parts. Finally, we will indicate possible solutions
    to close the gaps. The work item will consider the relevant work of other industry
    bodies relating to inter-MEC system communication (e.g. GSMA, 5GAA) and all relevant
    work done in ETSI.
