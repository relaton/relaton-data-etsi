  content: "ES 202 076, version 1.1.2 specifies a minimum set of spoken commands required
    to control the generic and most common functions of ICT devices and services that
    use speaker independent speech recognition. It specifies the necessary and most
    common vocabularies to be supported by ICT devices and services for voice input,
    including command, control and editing.\r\nES 202 076 is applicable to the functions
    required for navigation, information retrieval, basic call handling and configuration
    of preferences. It also addresses the most common telecommunication services.
    \r\nES 202 076 specifies user tested commands for the languages with the largest
    number of native speakers in the European Union: English, French, German, Italian
    and Spanish, as spoken in their respective countries. \r\nThis revision shall
    provide the similar commands specified in other European languages languages,
    language versions and possibly update the list of ICT commands addressed (methodology
    guidance is already provided). \r\nThe present work will update ES 202 076 to
    be fully applicable to the languages of the European Union (EU) member states
    as of June 2004, near-term enlargement candidate countries and the official languages
    of the EFTA countries and Russian.\r\nFurthermore, the work will consider to additionally
    cover European minority languages and major non European languages used in Europe.
    In addition, the below listed languages not covered by the above will be examined
    for coverage:\r\n Belarusian, Macedonian (the official language of the Former
    Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia), Serbian and Ukrainian;\r\n Albanian;\r\n Moldavian;
    and\r\n Croatian.?\r\nThe work will not cover dialogue design issues, the full
    range of supplementary telecommunications services, performance related issues,
    natural spoken numbers covering more than one digit (other than \"double\") or
    speech output."
