  content: "This new ETS will contain the access protocol for shared channels\r\nas
    well as the requirements and methods of measurement relating to the\r\nparameters
    used in this protocol (as given in the I-ETS 300 113).\r\n(Proposals for amendments
    received by RES 2 will be considered,\r\nhowever fundamental changes to methods
    of measurement and\r\ncorresponding limits are excluded.)\r\nThis item and RE/RES-02-12,
    the revision of I-ETS 300 113 for\r\nupgrading to an ETS, need to be available
    at the same time.\r\n "
