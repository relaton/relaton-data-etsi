    as part of the NFV Release 5. This edition will add support management of PIM
    as an NFV-MANO managed entity to fulfil the functional requirements specified
    in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 010. The scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-IFA
    031 specifies the interface requirements, the interfaces and the necessary information
    elements enabling the fault, configuration and information, performance, state
    and log management of NFV-MANO functional entities. In addition, the document
    also describes the framework to support the management of NFV-MANO functional
    entities. The different aspects specified in NFV-IFA 031 have been analysed firstly
    in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 021."
