  content: "The high-level requirements for NGN processing overload control are detailed
    in TS 181 005, though the mechanisms for meeting these requirements are missing
    from TISPAN NGN Release 1. Potential overload controls for NGNs have been discussed
    in the DTR WI02026 which describes the key overload functional entities and there
    is now a need to document and agree the specific requirements for overload controls
    for TISPAN NGN.\r\nThe new work item will form a normative stage 2 description
    of the requirements for processing overload control in release 2+.  Key elements
    will be:\r\nRelationship between the functional architecture and the physical
    manifestation of NGNs in the context of overload control.\r\nElucidation of the
    fundamental differences and similarities between processing overload control and
    RACS, as both are forms of admission control\r\nImplications of cross domain operation\r\nPriority
    considerations (Emergency)\r\nSecurity requirements\r\nRequirements for an overload
    control API."
