  content: The objective of this WI is to analyse the main protocols handled within
    the customer premises network (CPN) for different purposes (data plane, control
    plane, management plane) on the interfaces between customer network gateway (CNG)
    and customer devices or between different devices, as defined by WI05015 and WI05012.
    An additional objective is also to define possible needs for implementing mechanisms
    on the Customer Network Gateway (CNG) for protocols adaptation between the CPN
    and the NGN core
