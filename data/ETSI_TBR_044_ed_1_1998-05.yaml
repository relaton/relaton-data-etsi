abstract:
- content: "This TBR specifies those technical requirements under Articles 4.1 to\r\n4.5
    of Council Directive 93/97/EEC that apply to satellite earth\r\nstation equipment
    that is capable of operation in one or more of the\r\nfollowing frequency ranges:\r\n
    - 1 530,0 to 1 533,0 MHz and 1 555,0 to 1 559,0 MHz (Space - Earth);\r\n- 1 626,5
    to 1 645,5 MHz and 1 656,5 to 1 660,5 MHz (Earth to Space);\r\n of the Mobile
    Satellite Service (MSS).\r\nThese requirements are taken from ETS 300 423.\r\n
    This TBR does not contain the essential requirements under Article 4.6\r\nfor
    interworking via the public telecommunications network in\r\njustified cases,
    and does not provide any guarantee of correct\r\ninterworking between satellite
    earth station equipment.\r\n This TBR specifies the requirements for satellite
    earth station\r\nequipment that:\r\n -\tis capable of being used either for transmission
    only, or for\r\ntransmission and reception (transmit-receive), or for reception
    only\r\n(receive-only), of radio-communications signals in any of the bands\r\nspecified
    above, and\r\n -\tis not intended for use as part of the public\r\ntelecommunications
    network.\r\n This TBR applies to all satellite equipment as described above,\r\nirrespective
    of whether the satellite earth station equipment provides\r\nadditional interfaces,
    telecommunications services or functions.\r\nHowever additional TBRs may also
    apply.\r\n"
