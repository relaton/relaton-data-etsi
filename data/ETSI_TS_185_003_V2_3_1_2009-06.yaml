  content: The WI is to provide maintenance to the TS 185 003 document defining  the
    stage 2 CNG specifications, including architectural building blocks to be included
    in the CNG to support the interworking with control plane NGN architecture, both
    for the transport layers (NASS, RACS) and for the service layer. The WI will also
    define the interfaces between the NGN architectural blocks involved and the corresponding
    CNG functions here defined, as well as between the CNG and the Customer Devices
    when appropriate.
