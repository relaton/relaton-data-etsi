  content: 'The objective of this work is to provide a standardized method to measure
    and assess the environmental performance of smartphones. It suggests a method
    to evaluate an aggregate score, reflecting the overall environmental performance
    considering material efficiency and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) aspects. This
    proposed new standard aims to evaluate the following attributes of a smartphone:
    - Durability - Reparability, reusability and upgradeability - Recyclability and
    recoverability - Use of hazardous or restricted substances - Use of recycled or
    renewable materials - Characteristics of the product packaging - Environmental
    impact consideration.'
