  content: 'This work item will: (i) Assess the state-of-the-art materials for THz
    communication e.g., electronics, photonics, plasmonics (ii) Study the feasibility
    of different channel bandwidths considering component technologies, circuits and
    systems (iii) Study the effects of non-linear and frequency selective hardware
    (iv) Characterize RF/analog impairments based on simulations/measurements and
    obtain suitable RF impairment models in THz frequency range (v) Study low complexity
    large antenna array and packaging technologies (vi) Assess overall device complexity
    and cost impact (vii) Study the state of art for RF subsystems (transceiver, front
    end, antenna) in the THz frequency range (viii) Study the energy efficiency of
    state-of-the-art materials and RF subsystems on transmission and/or reception.'
