  content: The work item aims at improving cyber security by initially identifying,
    then advancing changes to technology standards.  Potential changes would be aimed
    at technology protocols such as the Internet Protocol stack, but could be anywhere
    or of any form. The work will be looking practically and fundamentally at what
    changes could be made that would equip network gateways with information or tools
    to be even more effective.
