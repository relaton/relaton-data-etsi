abstract:
- content: "This report will provide a comprehensive review on the definition of agents,
    how agents can be used for network and service management and how they can fit
    in the ZSM framework.  To achieve this, we will focus on use cases involving agents
    for network and service  management and on multi-agent communication use cases.
    \r\nAs autonomous technologies continue to advance, the use of autonomous agents
    for network and service management becomes relevant.  \r\nIn addition, effective
    communication between agents is important for coordinating tasks, sharing knowledge,
    and optimizing performance across various applications.  This report will review
    its applicability for zero-touch network and service management. \r\nBy analyzing
    existing frameworks and methodologies, this report aims to provide recommendations
    of additional capabilities needed in the ZSM framework to support utilization
    of agents.\r\nCollaboration with other SDOs (e.g. in IRTF NMRG, ITU-T SG13, TM
    Forum) will be recommended when appropriate.\r\n"
