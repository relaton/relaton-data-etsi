  content: "This document will look at the end-to-end quality of service implications
    of planned and existing Next Generation Network and hybrid technology network
    architectures including mobile architectures. The first part summaries a study
    of real-world architectures made based on material declared by network operators,
    material made available through TISPAN and STQ members and, possibly, by surveying
    operators. The second part consists in an analysis  of the network performance
    (including delay, jitter, packet loss) to be expected for specific access and
    core architectures, based on declared figures or existing standards. The third
    part defines Multiple reference connections, based on various access and core
    architectures and technologies, and their end-to-end performance and QoS characteristics
    determined. The last part provides recommendations on new standards needed and
    changes required to existing standards. \r\nThe focus is on QoS of voice applications,
    but other applications are also considered where information is available (e.g.
    multimedia applications)."
