  content: Standard ways of certifying roles and attributes are starting to emerge,
    such as; Attribute Certificate standards from the IETF, using extensions to existing
    authentication certificates, and others.  Such standards may be used to support
    the notion of roles within an organization or professional roles.  The implications
    of the requirements of the Directive need to be investigated. Conclusions and
    recommendations based on the investigation would be documented in a Technical
    report called  "Requirements for certifying roles and attributes".
