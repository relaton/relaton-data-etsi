  content: "One of the challenges for a successful commercial deployment of Reconfigurable
    Radio Systems (RRS) technologies is to provide an adequate level of security.
    While RRS should guarantee the same level of security of conventional wireless
    communication systems, they may also present new vulnerabilities or security threats.
    \r\nThe intent of this Work Item is to complete the previous set of security requirements,
    complementing the exiting TS by taking into account the following RRS use cases:\r\n1)\tremote
    attestation of the Reconfigurable Equipment status (installed Radio Application
    and DoC) \r\n2)\tremote control of Reconfigurable Equipment status (use case configuration
    enforcement of reconfigurable equipment covering e.g. radio front-end status,
    RA configuration, and cognitive radio operational mode)\r\n3)\tdistribution and
    enforcement of mobility policies\r\n4)\tmanagement of orphaned devices"
