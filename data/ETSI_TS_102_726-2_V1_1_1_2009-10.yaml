  content: "This technical specification (TS) contains the Test Suite Structure (TSS)
    and Test Purposes (TP) to test the ERM; Digital Private Mobile Radio using FDMA
    with a channel spacing of 6,25 kHz as defined in TS 102 658 v1.1.1.\r\nThe objective
    of this test specification is to provide a basis for conformance tests for ERM
    Digital Private Mobile Radio equipment giving a high probability of inter-operability
    between different manufacturer's equipment.\r\nThe ISO standard for the methodology
    of conformance testing (ISO/IEC 9646-1 and ISO/IEC 9646-2) as well as the ETSI
    rules for conformance testing (ETS 300 406]) are used as a basis for the test
    methodology."
