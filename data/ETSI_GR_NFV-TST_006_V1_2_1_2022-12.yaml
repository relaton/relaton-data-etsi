abstract:
- content: 'This revision of NFV-TST 006 will extend the current scope of the report
    to analyze and provide recommendations on how to enhance the support for joint
    delivery pipeline. NFV-TST 006 provides guidance and recommendations on methods
    to leverage DevOps and CI/CD techniques across the VNF provider to service provider
    boundary, or any combination of developer, installation and operational entities.
    It outlines the implications of the processes with regard to the impact of the
    VNF package handoff between VNF provider and service provider, the required functionality
    in the NFV system, the different deployment and operational options by: a) exploring
    use cases, b) defining the steps in the process, c) defining the metrics and measurements,
    d) defining the test procedures, e) defining post handoffs tests, and f) providing
    recommendations on VNF Package.'
