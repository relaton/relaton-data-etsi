  content: this work will identify additional requirements to be potentially submitted
    to oneM2M in the areas of discovery and query languages (syntax and semantic),
    by means of the development of relevant use cases. As a minimum, this work should
    include discovery of specific information and of aggregated information, and interaction
    with external sources of data and queries. The oneM2M architecture, the oneM2M
    semantic approach, the current oneM2M capabilities and SAREF will be at the basis
    of these use cases and requirements.
