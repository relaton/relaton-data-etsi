abstract:
- content: "To describe traffic capacity and spectrum requirements\r\nfor multi-system
    and multi-service DECT applications\r\ncoexisting in a common frequency band.
    Configurations for\r\ntypical DECT applications, and relevant mixes of these,\r\nincluding
    residential, office, public and RLL applications,\r\nshall be defined and analysed,
    mainly by advanced simulations.\r\nUpdate with new simulation results for RLL
    using more relevant parameters (including propagation model), and update with
    new results on co-existance.\r\n\r\n"
