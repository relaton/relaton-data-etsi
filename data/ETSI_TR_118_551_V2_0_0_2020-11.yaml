abstract:
- content: "The guide will list the CRUDN messages for managing some of the main resources
    defined in TS-0001. It aims at providing the description and associated flow in
    basic examples.  It is foreseesn to use HTTP binding and JSON serialization as
    example. Other binding and serialization could be considered later, or in a companion
    document.\r\nIt also aims to use this list as a common sets of APIs and extend
    them to include other APIs (such as 3GPP interworking) so developers will have
    an option to write applications that can run across different platforms and specific
    implementations.\r\n"
