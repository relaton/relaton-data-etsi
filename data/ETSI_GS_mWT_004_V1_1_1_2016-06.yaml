abstract:
- content: 'Purpose of this Work Item is informative to investigate the feasibility
    of using unlicensed band by analysing interference levels in co-channel and adjacent
    channels in dense deployement of PP radio at the street level taking into considerations
    equipment characteristics, capacities and BW requirements, standards- available
    channels, antennas – available standards and propagation : oxygen absorption –
    loss and modeling.'
