  content: "It has been shown that end to end KPI results for multi-phase service
    tests (e.g. packet services) may depend on phase composition.\r\nThis WI shall
    review test methodologies and related statistical issues having the following
    interrelated goals:\r\n- Review/Identify expected \"typical end user behaviour\"\r\n-
    Check currently used alternatives in test flow against this typical behaviour\r\n-
    Clarify statistical requirements\r\n- Provide guidelines and quantitative assessment
    of expected practical overall error margins\r\nResults of this WI are expected
    to affect TS 102-250 document parts 5 and 6 in any case, and other parts possibly."
