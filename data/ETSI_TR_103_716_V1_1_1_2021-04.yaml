abstract:
- content: This work will develop a simulation with the goal to provide a proof of
    concept and a performance evaluation to support the selection and development
    of the discovery and query solution to be contributed to oneM2M. An extract of
    the simulation results will be used to support the discussion and the proposal
    with oneM2M.
