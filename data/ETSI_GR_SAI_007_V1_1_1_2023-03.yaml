  content: The intent of this work item is to extend from the published work of SAI
    to address the issues of design of AI platforms (data, algorithms, frameworks)
    that are able to give assurance of explainability and transparency of decisions.
    This is intended in part to also consider the impact of issues arising from regulation
    of AI to address ethics and misuse and to allow independent determination of bias
    (a light touch). The report will address both intrinsic and post-hoc analysis
    of AI systems.
