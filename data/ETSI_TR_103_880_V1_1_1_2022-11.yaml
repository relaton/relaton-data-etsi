abstract:
- content: "This work will develop a TR to inform ETSI members and wider parties of
    the challenges of developing harmonised standards in the context of future changes
    to the environment in which products are being developed and operated.\r\n\r\nThe
    TR will inform ETSI members and the business community more widely as to the history
    of ETSI standards and the current RED process plus what the changes in RED mean
    for them, including how more subjective requirements and assessments are becoming
    commonplace. Similar changes are expected in Standardisation Requests outside
    of RED scope, (e.g. AI), which this work might inform.\r\n\r\nETSI is currently
    in the process of addressing proposed RED articles, and the experience and lessons
    learnt from this process can and should inform ETSI processes in the handling
    of similar concerns, whether these arise in the context of a Standardisation Request
    or otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe content of the deliverble will be:\r\n- Explanation of
    the background and development of the RED: legislators’ intentions and the new
    legislative framework (NLF)\r\n- A short history of standards written for the
    RED\r\n- ETSI’s role: How ETSI Harmonised Standards cited in OJEU affect manufacturers
    and intermediaries (including SMEs & NBs) when placing equipment on the market
    (and what having no standards means) – the necessity for legal certainty.\r\n-
    Recent developments:\r\no activation of RED articles of 3.3/4;\r\no the HASC process;\r\no
    issues perceived by ETSI (and the EC) with recent developments, including implications
    beyond market placement (design process, operation) despite the RED’s inability
    to encompass service aspects, and the fear that industry and ETSI members are
    paying insufficient attention.\r\n- The activation process: the Delegated Act
    and Standardisation Request, and the role of ETSI and lessons learnt from interactions
    with the Commission during this process. Stages in the process where HAS consultants
    may and do engage, and outcomes and issues that may arise out of the actual realisation
    of those stages. Repercussions and impact of subjective factors put down in legislative
    text and impacting the assessment process (e.g. issues arising from Cybersecurity
    Risk Assessment)\r\n- Future (likely) timetable of the development the harmonised
    standards writing process, with emphasis on the fluid nature of developments,
    but noting the work being carried out by the EC taskforce to look into these aspects.\r\n-
    Sources of further information – eg TC Cyber Report and Article 29 of Directive
    95/46/EC\r\n- The deliverable TR may include recommendations for consideration
    by different stakeholders (Regulators, ESOs, industries etc) to overcome difficulties
    experienced.\r\n- Existing documentation (including TC Cyber’s TR and RED CA documents)
    will be referenced, wherever available\r\n- The TR will also consider the best
    way to prepare and distribute additional, brief, concise information on future
    new legislation (eg AI) or other issues affecting Members, Industry, Academia
    and other interested parties."
