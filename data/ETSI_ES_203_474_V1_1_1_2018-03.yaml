  content: "The deliverable aims at defining interface and architecture for injecting
    renewable energy and distributed power sources (generators such as gas fuel cell,
    external DC microgrid, ) into an up to 400V power system as defined in ITU-T L.architecture
    and compliant with ETSI EN 300 132-3-1.\r\n\r\nThe scope covers different items:
    \r\n-General power architectures, with or without 48V and AC distribution in sites
    \r\n-Which conditions to maintain up to 400V power system stability, reliability,
    proper battery charge and management, lightning protection coordination, EMC and
    transient limits\r\n-Specification of proper power sizing \r\n-Interface between
    the DC power system and the external sources (renewable energy, local fuel cells,
    distributed   power of a DC micro-grid)\r\n-Requirement for control-monitoring-metering\r\n-Assessment
    of performances: AC grid energy saving, reliability, flexibility,  environmental
    impact, \r\n\r\nIt does not include the detailed specification and sizing of renewable
    generators, fuel cells and of distributed power sources.\r\n\r\n------ Joint activity
    with ITU-T SG5/WP3 in SQ19/5 with reference L.renewable -------"
