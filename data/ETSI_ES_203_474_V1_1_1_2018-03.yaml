abstract:
- content: "The deliverable aims at defining interface and architecture for injecting
    renewable energy and distributed power sources (generators such as gas fuel cell,
    external DC microgrid, …) into an up to 400V power system as defined in ITU-T
    L.architecture and compliant with ETSI EN 300 132-3-1.\r\n\r\nThe scope covers
    different items: \r\n-General power architectures, with or without 48V and AC
    distribution in sites \r\n-Which conditions to maintain up to 400V power system
    stability, reliability, proper battery charge and management, lightning protection
    coordination, EMC and transient limits\r\n-Specification of proper power sizing
    \r\n-Interface between the DC power system and the external sources (renewable
    energy, local fuel cells, distributed   power of a DC micro-grid)\r\n-Requirement
    for control-monitoring-metering\r\n-Assessment of performances: AC grid energy
    saving, reliability, flexibility,  environmental impact, …\r\n\r\nIt does not
    include the detailed specification and sizing of renewable generators, fuel cells
    and of distributed power sources.\r\n\r\n------ Joint activity with ITU-T SG5/WP3
    in SQ19/5 with reference L.renewable -------"
