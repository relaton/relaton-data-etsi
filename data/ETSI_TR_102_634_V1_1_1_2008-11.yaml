abstract:
- content: "This Ecma Technical Report is one of a series of publications that provides
    an overview of IP-based enterprise communication involving Corporate telecommunication
    Networks (CNs) (also known as enterprise networks) and in particular Next Generation
    Corporate Networks (NGCN). The series particularly focuses on session level communication
    based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), with an emphasis on inter-domain
    communication. This includes communication between parts of the same enterprise
    (on dedicated infrastructures and/or hosted), between enterprises and between
    enterprises and public networks. Particular consideration is given to Next Generation
    Networks (NGN) as public networks and as providers of hosted enterprise capabilities.
    Key technical issues are investigated, current standardisation work and gaps in
    this area are identified, and a number of requirements are stated. Among other
    uses, this series of publications can act as a reference for other standardisation
    bodies working in this field, including ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP, IETF and ITU-T.\r\n"
