abstract:
- content: This TR will outline component level Use Cases related to the standardization
    of interface operations for unified baseband signal processing radio applications
    for Mobile Devices (MD). These Use Cases will specify the interoperation among
    the mobile device’s baseband signal processing modules.  The baseband signal processing
    of unified radio applications includes multi-antenna signal processing as well
    as modem operation and synchronization. The Use Cases to be developed in this
    work will outline a variety of wireless network configurations and provide the
    baseband control, monitoring parameters and signal flows that need to be supported
    by the standardized baseband interfaces. This work will also outline Use Cases
    including a variety of configurations of radio application baseband blocks which
    are interconnected by the standardized interfaces.  The Use Cases to be outlined
    will include configurations of various multi-antenna technologies such as MIMO,
    Beam-forming, Direction Finding, etc, which could adopt various kinds of algorithms.
    In such Use Cases, the multi-antenna technology is applicable to a variety of
    radio waveforms. In a multi-radio system, standardized baseband interfaces among
    the radio components in the unified radio applications of MD could enable monitoring
    and control of the radio link state by management system components that are independent
    of the individual radio link technology. Such management, for example, may lead
    to more optimal link operation by communicating control parameters and monitoring
    information with the upper control layer regardless of radio applications.  Standardized
    interfaces may also enable a reconfigurable radio modem to be combined with a
    variety of multi-antenna configurations, which is essential for enhancing both
    communication capacity and quality of service. Thus, the Use Cases will include
    the transportation of parameters via the “Multiradio Interface for Software Defined
    Radio”. The Use Cases that will be outlined in this work will be considered for
    System Requirements and System Architecture specifications to be developed in
    ETSI RRS for internal and external signal flows across standardized baseband interfaces
    within a unified radio application for MD.
