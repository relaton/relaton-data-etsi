  content: "The purpose of this specification is to identify the Interworking\r\nFunctions
    (IWF s) and requirements for the interworking between a GSM\r\nPLMN and a PSPDN/ISDN
    for the support of packet services in GSM PLMNs.\r\nIn the GSM PLMN context the
    packet services are associated with bearer\r\nservices and are described in GSM
    02.02. The generally defined GSM PLM\r\nuser-network access as defined in the
    respective GSM TSs (see\r\nreferences) forms the basis for defining the particularities
    for the\r\nprovision of packet services to the GSM PLMN subscribers. Network\r\ninternal
    interfaces for the support of packet services in the\r\npan-European ISDN are
    defined in ETSI standards, which are also taken\r\nas a basis.\r\nUser-network
    access and network internal interfaces are defined to\r\nprovide the packet services.\r\n
