  content: "This work provides a framework for concurrent tests of multiple services.
    The respective tests could relate to RCS/RCSe services or as a composition of
    parallel usage of services.\r\nSome elements of such an approach exist - in a
    limited way - already, e.g. TS 102 250-2 clause 6.12 and TR 103 114. This work
    is based on a top-level approach which is also modular and scalable with respect
    to new services. Also, the framework addresses and integrates measurement methodology,
    in particular reproducibility aspects."
