  content: Industry sectors have addressed the assessment of cyber risks, particularly
    as regards software, in a largely silo manner. On the other hand, recently introduced  and
    even upcoming  legislation mandates a horizontal treatment of cyber risks that
    spans multiple industry sectors. And where such legislation holds for the placement
    of products and services in the EU Single Market, stringent requirements apply.
    Given that risk assessment is predominantly informed by the context in which products
    and services operate, the (re)use of sectorial risk assessments (e.g. consumer,
    industrial, medical, etc.) in the development of technical standards supportive
    to such horizontal legislations has been a complex and arduous exercise. Particularly
    so when it comes to subjective factors  inherent in any risk assessment  that
    should be kept under control. Currently, this is largely an open issue for the
    industry. Hence there is a need for an adapter concept (e.g. an approach, method,
    guidance, practice, or other suitable formalism) that facilitates reuse of the
    investment made by different industry sectors in the assessment of risk, while
    providing a uniform interface fit for the conformance assessment requirements
    and other legal concerns of such horizontal legislations. Such a unified adapter
    is currently lacking. This WI shall address this gap and analyse the areas where
    subjective factors play a role (and thus should be handled diligently) in this
    context. Moreover, it shall introduce the challenges that accompany the assessment
    of software-related risks in the context of market placement and present  essential
    principles to inform the risk assessment of products based on their properties.
    Finally, a method to constrain and control subjectivity based on these principles
    and developed to address the challenges of said risk assessments shall be presented.
