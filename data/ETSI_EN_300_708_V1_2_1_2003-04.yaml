abstract:
- content: The former EACEM Project Team 1.4 (Data Services), the originator of the
    ETSI standard ETS 300 708, prepared some corrections and additions. The most significant
    addition is a new format of independent data line (IDL) (format B) which contains
    a forward error correcting (FEC) protocol rather than a cyclic redundancy check
    (CRC) as used with the current format A.  The requirements for this new packet
    are described in detail in EACEM technical report TR-039. The details are given
    in document J23d06, submitted to the 23rd meeting of JTC Broadcast.
