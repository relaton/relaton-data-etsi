  content: "Security was one of the points of attention of CSC Phase 1. Though the
    availability of Cloud Computing standards related to security and their level
    of maturity were considered as relatively good, some areas of concern were remaining,
    in particular with respect to the proof of conformance (seen as a moving target).
    \r\n\r\nSome of the priorities identified in WI DMI/NTECH-00030 may be reviewed
    under this prism. The objective will be to provide users with an updated view
    of the interplay between standards, conformance and regulation and consequently,
    how they can shape their decisions in this space."
