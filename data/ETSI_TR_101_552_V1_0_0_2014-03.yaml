  content: 'This Technical Report (TR) incorporates all information and documentation
    needed in the frame of the procurement process in order to allow conveying the
    assessment of accessibility via conformity with the functional accessibility requirements
    contained in EN 301 549 (see clause 2, i), regardless of whether self-declaration,
    second party attestation or third party certification is requested, and with award
    criteria: the criteria, by which the award of a contract is judged. In addition,
    this TR provides procuring bodies with guidance on conformity assessment mechanisms
    for accessibility as part of contract management in the post-award stage. It is
    also useful in the pre-procurement research phase as well as during the contract
    negotiations. Finally it may be consulted by bidders preparing an offer.'
