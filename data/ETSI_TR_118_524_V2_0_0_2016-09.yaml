abstract:
- content: "The objective of this work item is to study and specify interworking architecture
    options between oneM2M architecture and 3GPP Rel-13 architecture for Service Capability
    Exposure as defined in TS 23.682.\r\nDifferent deployment scenarios where SCEF
    is hosted by MNO vs when it is hosted by M2M Service Provider or hosted by a 3rd
    party service provider will be considered. \r\nDiffernet architecure options will
    be considerd including the following:\r\n•The IN CSE acts as SCEF i.e. oneM2M
    CSEs interfacing directly to 3GPP network\r\n•The IN CSE connected to the SCEF
    using APIs defined by other SDOs (e.g. NetAPI defined by OMA)\r\n"
