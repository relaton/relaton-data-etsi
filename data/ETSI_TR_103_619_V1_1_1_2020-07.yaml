abstract:
- content: 'To present recommendations and guidelines for users seeking to adopt a
    QSC model and who will need to migrate from an existing non-QSC environment. The
    intent is that the guidance and recommendation discuss both the high level strategic
    and lower level practical issues to be considered for migration from non-QSC to
    QSC algorithms and key management. This is intended to complement some of the
    hybrid schemes considered in the VPN work item as well as introduce a wider view
    of the topic. To address issues such as impact on PKIs, on assurance of standards
    across the board that support QSC and hybridisation, address risks where gaps
    may exist. '
