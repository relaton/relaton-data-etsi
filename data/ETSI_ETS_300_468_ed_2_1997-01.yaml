abstract:
- content: "The provision of a solution for the “Seamless Transition Networks”\r\nwith
    respect to the “Network Identification Table” in the case of\r\nSMATV and some
    CATW networks was not covered by the ETS 300 468 (SI)\r\nEd 1. As a consequence
    HISPASAT, RAI, DTI, SAT/Sagem, Sharp and the\r\nSpanish Administration proposed
    revision EWP items on ETS 300 468 and\r\nETR 211.\r\nSpecification of Service
    Information (SI) data which forms part of\r\nDVB/MPEG-2 bitstreams, in order that
    the user can be provided with\r\ninformation to assist in selection of services
    and/or events within\r\nthe bitstream, and so that the Integrated Receiver Decoder
    (IRD) can\r\nautomatically configure itself for the selected service.\r\nSI is
    specified in ISO/IEC 13818-1 as Programme Specific\r\nInformation (PSI). This
    specification complements the PSI\r\nby providing data to aid automatic tuning
    of IRDs, and addditional\r\ninformation intended for display to the user, mainly
    in text form.\r\nThe manner of presentation of the information is not specified,\r\nand
    IRD manufacturers have freedom to choose appropriate\r\npresentation methods.\r\nIt
    is expected that Electronic Programme Guides (EPG) will be a\r\nfeature of Digital
    TV transmissions. The definition of EPG is\r\noutside the scope of the SI specification,
    but the data contained\r\nwithin the SI specified here could be used as basis
    for an EPG.\r\nThe present specification describes Service Information (SI) for
    use\r\nin broadcast MPEG-2 bitstreams. The MPEG-2 System layer specifies\r\nSI
    which is referred to as Programme Specific Information (PSI).\r\nThe PSI data
    provides information to enable automatic configuration\r\nof the receiver to demultiplex
    and decode the various streams of\r\nprogramme within the multiplex.\r\n "
