  content: "The provision of a solution for the Seamless Transition Networks\r\nwith
    respect to the Network Identification Table in the case of\r\nSMATV and some CATW
    networks was not covered by the ETS 300 468 (SI)\r\nEd 1. As a consequence HISPASAT,
    RAI, DTI, SAT/Sagem, Sharp and the\r\nSpanish Administration proposed revision
    EWP items on ETS 300 468 and\r\nETR 211.\r\nSpecification of Service Information
    (SI) data which forms part of\r\nDVB/MPEG-2 bitstreams, in order that the user
    can be provided with\r\ninformation to assist in selection of services and/or
    events within\r\nthe bitstream, and so that the Integrated Receiver Decoder (IRD)
    can\r\nautomatically configure itself for the selected service.\r\nSI is specified
    in ISO/IEC 13818-1 as Programme Specific\r\nInformation (PSI). This specification
    complements the PSI\r\nby providing data to aid automatic tuning of IRDs, and
    addditional\r\ninformation intended for display to the user, mainly in text form.\r\nThe
    manner of presentation of the information is not specified,\r\nand IRD manufacturers
    have freedom to choose appropriate\r\npresentation methods.\r\nIt is expected
    that Electronic Programme Guides (EPG) will be a\r\nfeature of Digital TV transmissions.
    The definition of EPG is\r\noutside the scope of the SI specification, but the
    data contained\r\nwithin the SI specified here could be used as basis for an EPG.\r\nThe
    present specification describes Service Information (SI) for use\r\nin broadcast
    MPEG-2 bitstreams. The MPEG-2 System layer specifies\r\nSI which is referred to
    as Programme Specific Information (PSI).\r\nThe PSI data provides information
    to enable automatic configuration\r\nof the receiver to demultiplex and decode
    the various streams of\r\nprogramme within the multiplex.\r\n "
