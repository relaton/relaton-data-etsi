abstract:
- content: "In the current fast evolving world, where various technologies are competing,
    interoperability is more than ever a fundamental feature of standardization in
    telecommunications and every effort is expected to ensure it across networks.
    \ Despite these standardization efforts the user experience has shown, on several
    occasions, that interoperability has failed.\r\nCE label and Keymark are useless
    in this aspect.\r\nTherefore users, considering the growing complexity of telecommunication
    technology, when purchasing devices or servcies would like to have a clear indication
    on how far interoperability is provided.\r\nThe work will undertake to define
    a minimum set of interoperability features abd ways to check they are fulfilled
    for the main telecommunication services, e.g. fixed and mobile telephony basic
    and supplementary services, directory services, data transmissions, internet access,
    e-mail, etc."
