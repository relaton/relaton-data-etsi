abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) describes the\r\nmanagement
    of the security related aspects in the GSM/DCS PLMN. The\r\nmanagement of the
    relevant security services is addressed with respect\r\nto the following aspects:\r\n–
    Overview of the security features;\r\n– Description of the relevant management
    procedures;\r\n– Modeling using the object oriented paradigm.\r\n The definitions
    and descriptions of the security features and\r\nmechanisms are contained in the
    specifications of the underlying\r\nprocedures and are not defined in this ETS.
    References to appropriate\r\nGSM/DCS specifications have been made throughout
    the ETS, where\r\nnecessary. Issues relating to the security of management (e.g.
    file\r\ntransfer security, database security, inter operator security, etc.)\r\nare
    not covered in this ETS.\r\n"
