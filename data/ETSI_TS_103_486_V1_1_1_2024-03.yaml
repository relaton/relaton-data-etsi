abstract:
- content: "The present document describes a model of identity management applicable
    to IoT devices. The present document defines a data structure, described as authority-attribute
    trees, for managing identifiers and properties of a device, where identifiers
    and properties are exposed in a number of use cases including discovery, attachment
    and communication. The present document describes the application of these authority-attribute
    trees to an existing ontology, SAREF. \r\nThe present document outlines the requirements
    of cryptographic methods to establish trust in authority-attribute trees and maps
    those requirements to existing cryptographic models (e.g. to functional encryption,
    to symmetric and asymmetric systems). \r\n\r\nThe present document does not define
    or make recommendations about policies for users or devices with regards to in
    revealing identity information, or accepting or rejecting discovery based on this
    information.\r\n\r\nThe present document uses several informative annexes to show
    how the identity management model can be applied: Annex A shows a discovery model
    and generic message types that allow selectively exposing information; Annex B
    shows how the identity management model can be applied in the 'Obligation-of-Trust'
    protocol to allow discovery of authority-attribute trees by other devices; Annex
    C illustrates how the identity management model applies to existing protocols
    and their ability to control discovery"
