abstract:
- content: This work item will specify the functionality of the centralized DCC control
    entity including the required interfaces and parameters for controlling the DCC
    mechanisms in the facility layer, network and transport layer and the access layer.
    The centralized DCC entity will be responsible of evaluating the actual DCC state
    of the active ITS G5A and ITS G5B channels based on status information from the
    access layer, the network layer and the facility layer. In addition the DCC status
    should be predicted for the following transmission intervals.
