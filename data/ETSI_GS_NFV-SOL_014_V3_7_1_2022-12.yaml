abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-SOL 014 conducts NFV Release 3. It corrects errors,
    ambiguities, misalignments, and applies editorial modifications (i.e. Corrections
    of category F and D as described in ETSI TWPs Annex L). This edition does not
    add or modify features, nor does it extend scope of the former Release 3 published
    edition summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-SOL 014 specifies a set of YAML-based
    data models for descriptor-based virtualised resource management fulfilling the
    requirements concerning the input and output information exchanged over the virtualised
    resource management interfaces specified in the ETSI GS NFV-IFA 005, and the ETSI
    GS NFV-IFA 006. NFV-SOL 014 focuses on data models used in the virtualised resource
    descriptors for the Virtualised Compute interfaces, Virtualised Network interfaces
    and Virtualised Storage interfaces, which are used to perform orchestration and
    lifecycle management for consumable virtualised resources comprised of compute,
    network and storage. NFV-SOL 014 also focuses on data models used in the virtualised
    resource descriptors for the Virtualised Resources Change Notification interfaces
    and Virtualised Resources Fault Management interfaces. Other virtualised resource
    management interfaces, as well as data models for information specified in ETSI
    GS NFV-IFA 011 and ETSI GS NFV-IFA 014, are out of the scope of NFV-SOL 014."
