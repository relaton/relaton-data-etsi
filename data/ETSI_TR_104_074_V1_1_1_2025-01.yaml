  content: The purpose of the present document is to provide recommendations on methodologies
    for testing and validation of nApp based services over 5G networks. The present
    document includes recommendations covering the aspects of an nApp validation framework
    by providing definitions of 5G relevant KPIs for nApps, the application and network
    functions making up nApps, and the services composed of the nApps. Moreover, recommendations
    on the testing and validation environment, on involved processes, and, finally,
    on the design of the nApps and services under test. Such recommendations can be
    equally applicable to a wide range of nApp composed services, application cases
    and may also be applicable beyond 5G scenarios.
