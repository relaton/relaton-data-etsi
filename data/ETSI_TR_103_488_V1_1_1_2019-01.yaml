abstract:
- content: This work creates a framework for applicability/suitability of the different
    video Quality of Service metrics and the description of realistic and open implementation
    scenarios and ways to compare/assess and combine the performance across different
    video services, as well as the definition of respective QoS parameters and measurement
    methodology, where needed. The work considers - but is not limited to - services
    such as conversational, live and streaming-based video services and focuses on
    an end-to-end perspective; a strict end-user, service-oriented point of view.
    Here, end-to-end is understood as from a service user/provider to a service user/provider.
