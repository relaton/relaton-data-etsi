abstract:
- content: "The work item will specify the following aspects: a) functional requirements
    on sets of VNF generic OAM functions, specifications of the VNF generic OAM functions,
    and requirements on the architectural setup in relation to the NFV architectural
    framework, b) interface requirements for the set of interfaces exposed by the
    VNF generic OAM functions towards NFV-MANO and other management entities, c) requirements
    and modeling of runtime information exposed through the specified interfaces towards
    NFV-MANO and other management entities, d) service requirements for the interactions
    on interfaces with the VNFs that make use of and are associated to the VNF generic
    OAM functions, and finally e) requirements and modeling of design time information
    of descriptors for the specified VNF generic OAM functions. Relevant recommendations
    from ETSI GR NFV-EVE 019 will be considered.\r\nThe resulting deliverable will
    contain normative provisions."
