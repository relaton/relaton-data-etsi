abstract:
- content: 'This Technical Specification will define the Radio Programming Interface
    (RPI) supporting reconfiguration in mobile devices – this interface has been identified,
    among others, as standardization candidate in ETSI TS 103 095 following the RRS
    work flow recommendation (stage 4: “Protocol and Interfaces  Specification(TS)”).
    The work will be based on the Use Cases defined in ETSI TR 103 062 (“Use Cases
    and Scenarios for SDR Reference Architecture for Mobile Device”), ETSI TR 102
    839 (“Multiradio Interface for Software Defined Radio (SDR); Mobile Device Architecture
    and Services”) , ETSI TR 102 944 (“Use Cases for Baseband Interfaces for Unified
    Radio Applications of Mobile Device”), the requirements defined in ETSI TS 102
    969 (“Radio Reconfiguration related Requirements for Mobile Devices”) and EN 302
    969 and the Radio Reconfiguration related Architecture for Mobile Devices defined
    in ETSI TS 103 095 and EN 303 095. It will furthermore be a complement to the
    Multi-Radio Interface (MURI) defined in EN 303 146-1, the Reconfigurable Radio
    Frequency Interface (RRFI) defined in TS 103 146-2 and the Unified Radio Application
    Interface (URAI).'
