    In clause 4, the configuration of a PLMN\r\nis described as well as the organisation
    of the functional entities;\r\nthe configuration presented is the most general
    in order to cope with\r\nall the possible implementations which can be imagined
    in the\r\ndifferent countries. To illustrate that purpose, some examples of\r\npossible
    configurations are presented. Clause 5 of this specification\r\ncontains a brief
