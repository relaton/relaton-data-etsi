    not limited to native K8S Helm model, ONAP ASD;\r\n-\tAnalysis of differences
    between VNF LCM, PM and FM operations and the APIs used in the open source projects;
    \ \r\n-\tFeasibility to improve the VNFD information model and VNF LCM operations
    based on the above analysis. \r\nRecommendations on the normative work related
