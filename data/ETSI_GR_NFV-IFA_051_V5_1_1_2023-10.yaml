abstract:
- content: "This work item aims to analyze the gaps on VNF management between ETSI
    NFV specifications and the related open source projects, such as but not limited
    to ONAP, OSM and Openstack Tacker, the work includes:\r\n-\tAnalysis of differences
    between VNFD model and the model used in the open source porject, such as but
    not limited to native K8S Helm model, ONAP ASD;\r\n-\tAnalysis of differences
    between VNF LCM, PM and FM operations and the APIs used in the open source projects;
    \ \r\n-\tFeasibility to improve the VNFD information model and VNF LCM operations
    based on the above analysis. \r\nRecommendations on the normative work related
    for improving the VNFD information model and VNF LCM interface operations according
