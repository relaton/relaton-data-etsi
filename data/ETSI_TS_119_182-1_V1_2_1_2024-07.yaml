abstract:
- content: "Update ETSI TS 119 182-1 v1.1.1 for: \r\n\r\n1) Incorporating any suitable
    amendment resulting from the study of the comments made by implementers during
    the first JAdES Remote Interoperability Plugtests(C) conducted in November/December
    2021.\r\n\r\n2) Incorporating a new unsigned attribute for covering specific use
    cases of revocation data refresh.\r\n\r\n3) Deal with other comments arrived from
    ESI members or implementers outside the context of the mentioned Plugtests(C),
    as for example: a request to relax the requirement of making critical all the
    new signed attributes defined by ETSI TS 119 182-1, and thinking about the possibility
    of reducing the number of signed attributes containing certificate references.\r\n\r\n"
