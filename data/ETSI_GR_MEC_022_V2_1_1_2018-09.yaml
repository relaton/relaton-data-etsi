  content: This work item focuses on identifying the necessary support provided by
    Multi-access Edge Computing for V2X applications. The work will be a study with
    the intent to collect and analyse the relevant V2X use cases (including  the findings
    from external organisations), evaluate the gaps from the defined MEC features
    and functions, and identify the new requirements including new features and functions.When
    necessary, this may include identifying new multi-access edge services or interfaces,
    as well as changes to existing multi-access edge services or interfaces, data
    models, application rules and requirements. The work item will recommend the necessary
    normative work to close these gaps if identified.
