  content: "Scope of work to be undertaken:  \r\nThe primary goal of this task is
    to correct TS 119 612 v1.1.1 from inconsistencies that have been discovered in
    Annex B with regards to the specifications provided in the main parts of the document.
    These inconsistencies were reflected in the resulting XSD file identified in Annex
    C (with hash values). One typo was also discovered in Annex G.4 were a reference
    to a section was not correct (see clause 6.4.3 instead of see clause 5.5.3).\r\n\r\nThe
    amendment of  CD 2009/767/EC have been adopted last 14th of October and has been
    published in the OJEU as CD 2013/662/EU (it refers to TS 119 612 v1.1.1).\r\nIt
    is not possible for the EC to change such a publication and they would really
    prefer not to amend it to point to another version of TS 119 612. A new update
    of the CD is anyway foreseen when the Regulation will be adopted but this is not
    before end of next year at the soonest. In the meantime MS will have to implement
    the CD on the basis of 119 612 v1.1.1.\r\n\r\nThe solution that the EC agreed
    consists in the delivery of the new/correct XSD file to the MS by the Commission
    (done) and the publication by ETSI of a new version of TS 119 612 without changing
    any core specification requirement but with reference to the correct XSD.\r\n
    \r\nIt was decided at ESI#42 meeting to:\r\n - remove from Annex B any XML schema
    definition as this is source for inconsistencies and is redundant with the files
    provided through Annec C. Annex B will then be limited to the necessary requirements
    and specifications not related to XML schema.\r\n - annex C will remain with the
    xml schema attached.\r\n - As the update is technical, the next published version
    is 1.2.1. use v1.1.2 for the draft).\r\n\r\nIndicative planning: \r\nWI is expected
    to start no later than 01/01/2014. The TS 119 612 v1.2.1 will be for comments
    for 2 weeks followed by an approval for 2 weeks if no major comments are made.
    Alternatively, a final draft for TC approval would be due no later than 24/01/2014
    so that approval could be given at ESI#42 meeting (3-5/02/2014). \r\nPublication
    as a TS would be expected by end February 2014. \r\nThis planning is indicative."
