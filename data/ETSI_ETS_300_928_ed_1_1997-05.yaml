  content: "This ETS describes the general aspects on how supplementary services\r\nin
    the GSM system are realized from a technical point of view.\r\nDescription of
    technical realization for specific supplementary\r\nservices can be found in GSM
    03.8x and 03.9x-series technical\r\nspecifications.\r\nAll supplementary services
    may require signalling on the radio path.\r\nSignalling procedures and messages
    used are defined in the GSM 04.8x\r\nand 04.9x-series of technical specifications.\r\nFor
    some supplementary services information needs to be transferred\r\nbetween the
    home location register (HLR), the visitor location\r\nregister (VLR) and the mobile
    services switching centre (MSC).\r\nSignalling procedures for such information
    transfer are defined in\r\ntechnical specification GSM 09.02.\r\nDefinitions and
    descriptions of supplementary services are given in\r\nthe GSM 02.8x and 02.9x-series
    of technical specifications.\r\nDefinitions are given in technical specification
    GSM 02.04.\r\nNOTE: The technical specifications on the technical realization
    of\r\nsupplementary services do not distinguish between subscriber, user and\r\ncustomer,
    since all three do not fully cover the textual needs.\r\nGenerally the term \"subscriber\"
    is used, even if this person is not\r\nhaving the subscription.\r\n"
