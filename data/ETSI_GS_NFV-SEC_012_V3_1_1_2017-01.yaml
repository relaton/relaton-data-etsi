abstract:
- content: 'Many different VNFs include components – VNFCIs, whether VMs or Containers
    – which contain sensitive data or algorithms.  These may need integrity and/or
    confidentiality protection from a number of different entities, including NFVI
    administrators.  Some elements of the Mangement and Orchestration domain also
    require such protection.  Equally, NFVI hosts must be assured that they are protected
    from malicious or compromised work loads.  This normative Work Item will describe
    a system architecture for the execution of sensitive NFV components, covering
    all of these use cases.  This system architecture will describe technical measures,
    software interfaces and hardware and software techniques.  The expectation is
    that for some use cases, sensitive and non-sensitive workloads may have to co-exist
    on the same platform, and protection one from the other is considered in scope
    of this WI. '
