  content: 'Many different VNFs include components  VNFCIs, whether VMs or Containers  which
    contain sensitive data or algorithms.  These may need integrity and/or confidentiality
    protection from a number of different entities, including NFVI administrators.  Some
    elements of the Mangement and Orchestration domain also require such protection.  Equally,
    NFVI hosts must be assured that they are protected from malicious or compromised
    work loads.  This normative Work Item will describe a system architecture for
    the execution of sensitive NFV components, covering all of these use cases.  This
    system architecture will describe technical measures, software interfaces and
    hardware and software techniques.  The expectation is that for some use cases,
    sensitive and non-sensitive workloads may have to co-exist on the same platform,
    and protection one from the other is considered in scope of this WI. '
