  content: "\"The purpose of this work item TM-04099, is to create a new section (Part
    5) to the existing EN 301 213 standard. This work item will address Multi-Carrier
    TDMA systems operating in the frequency band of 24.25 to 29.5GHz.  The new part
    5 will be a standard for Multi-carrier TDMA systems where each carrier may have
    different capacity, output level, and modulation.\r\nThe Work Item TM-04098 has
    addressed specific and restricted conditions to temporarily address the Multi
    carrier TDMA system concerns for identically modulated carriers within the same
    channel.\r\nThe changes to EN 301 213-3 that will incorporate the multi carrier
    TDMA issues will be adopted into the new part 5. Once the part 5 has been accepted,
    a new work item will created to amend the part 3 to remove all related issues
    to Multi carrier TDMA systems.\"\r\n\r\n"
