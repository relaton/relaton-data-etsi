  content: Since the publication of EG 202 009, additional work has been completed
    among the user organizations while new QoS related standards have been made available
    by ETSI. Also, according to the complaints received by the help desk of the user
    organizations, there is a growing users' concern about the mobile networks and
    the services provided via Internet including while using mobile access. Therefore
    in this revision, new QoS parameters need to be defined in this area, and specifically
    for Part 1, the main issues are changes in acknowledged vocabulary. There is also
    some need to put stress on the importance to make available the spreading of the
    results.
