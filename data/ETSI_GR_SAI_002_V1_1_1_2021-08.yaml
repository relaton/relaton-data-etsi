  content: "Data is a critical component in the development of AI systems. This includes
    raw data as well as information and feedback from other systems and humans in
    the loop, all of which can be used to change the function of the system by training
    and retraining the AI.\r\nHowever, access to suitable data is often limited causing
    a need to resort to less suitable sources of data. Compromising the integrity
    of training data has been demonstrated to be a viable attack vector against an
    AI system. This means that securing the supply chain of the data is an important
    step in securing the AI.\r\nThis report will summarise the methods currently used
    to source data for training AI along with the regulations, standards and protocols
    that can control the handling and sharing of that data. It will then provide gap
    analysis on this information to scope possible requirements for standards for
    ensuring traceability and integrity in the data, associated attributes, information
    and feedback, as well as the confidentiality of these."
