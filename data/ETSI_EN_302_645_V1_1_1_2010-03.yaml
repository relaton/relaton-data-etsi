abstract:
- content: "Creation of the new Harmonized Standard for GNSS (GPS/Galileo) Repeaters
    in line with the requirements identified in the draft ECC Report on GNSS Repeaters
    created by ECC WGSE.\r\nSome available GNSS repeater equipment transmits in a
    bandwidth Â±10MHz centered on either 1227.6 MHz or 1575.45 MHz. It should be recognised
    that equipment described as GNSS repeaters will in fact re-transmit any RNSS or
    other signal in the transmit frequency band. \r\n\r\nThe standard should clearly
    describe the reasons for standardisation, in this case compliance  with the R&TTE
    directive but also the protection of the primary (navigation) service.\r\nTransmit
    power and intended coverage area should be defined.\r\nThe standard should include
    limits for spurious emissions.\r\nThe standard should include limits for distortion
    of the repeated signal (linearity)\r\nThe standard should include receiver specification
    of the integrated receiver including: \r\n- The noise produced by the receiver
    degrading the retransmitted signal.\r\n- The sensitivity and susceptibility to
    blocking\r\n\r\nThe standard should include design parameters to prevent that
    the system introduces precision degradation in systems\r\nthat do not need the
    support of a GPS repeater .\r\nThe standard should include provisions for an indication
    in the retransmitted signal that the signal is not a satellite originated signal
    but retransmitted. e.g  by introducing a nonexistent satellite name. \r\n"
