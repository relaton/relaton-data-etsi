- content: "Standard covering the minimum set of characteristics for analogue\r\nand/or
    digital radio communication (speech and/or data) equipment\r\nwhich operates on
    narrowband channels (6.25 kHz). The Standard\r\ncovers equipment using constant
    or non-constant envelope modulation\r\nand having an external antenna connector.\r\n\r\nThis
    standard, together with EN 300 279, is intended to become a Harmonised Standard,
    the reference of which is intended to be published in the Official Journal of
    the European Communities referencing the EMC Directive.\r\n"
