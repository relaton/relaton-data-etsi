abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 030 continues the development of the specification
    as part of the NFV Release 4. This edition will add requirements to support the
    Release 4 features. The scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-IFA
    030 specifies the functional requirements, interfaces and operations to support
    the provision of network services across multiple administrative domains based
    on the interactions between NFVOs in different administrative domains (supported
    over the Or-Or reference point). NFV-IFA 030 also specifies the information elements
    exchanged over the specified interfaces. The different aspects specified in NFV-IFA
    030 are derived from ETSI GR NFV-IFA 028."
