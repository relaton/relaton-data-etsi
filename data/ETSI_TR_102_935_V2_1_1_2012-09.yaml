abstract:
- content: "Application of M2M architecture for the needs of Smart Grids: based on
    the high level framework developed by the ETSI Board (energy plane, control and
    connectivity plane, service plane), consider the applicability of the M2M platform
    to Smart Grids and derive a standard gap analysis: e.g. applicability of M2M APIs
    for Smart Grid applications, mechanisms to manage energy for end users, etc\r\nAn
    annex will be developed to document the most relevant Smart Grid use cases. These
    will be used as a basis for \r\n•\tDeriving initial high level requirements \r\n•\tDeveloping
    recommendations for future work within ETSI TC M2M.\r\n•\tHighlighting dependencies
    and relationships with other work within ETSI TCs and other standards organisations
    including the ones covering the energy plane: NIST, CEN/Cenelec and IEC in particular."
