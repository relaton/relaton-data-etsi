    of subscriber related event and call data. This\r\nincludes both the collection
    of call data from, and the distribution\r\nof tariff data to, the network elements.\r\nThe
    subscriber (IMSI) and mobile equipment (IMEI) related call and\r\nevent data collected
    is employed by a number of management activities\r\nincluding billing & accounting,
    statistical analysis and customer\r\ncare.\r\nThe tariff data in the network elements
    is required to support the\r\nsupplementary service \"Advice of Charge\".\r\nThe
    aim of this ETS is to describe both the network management\r\nfunctions required
    and the data involved.\r\n"
