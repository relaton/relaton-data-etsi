  content: "A sound field reproduction technique is described allowing the physical
    reproduction of real, prerecorded sound fields in a laboratory type environment.
    In contrast to other methodologies the technique is targeted to reproduce the
    spectral, temporal and spatial characteristics of sound fields. The method is
    intended to be used for testing modern type of terminals including advanced signal
    processing techniques including multi-microphone and array technologies. A background
    noise database is supplied with the standard taking into account types of background
    noise included in EG 202 396-1.\r\nThis revision is to include new sound field
    recording(s) in the database described in clause 8 and provide loudspeaker array
    support for increased periphony and sound field spatial reproduction support.
    If applicable, additional requirements on the maximum distortion and playback
    level of the loudspeakers/sub-woofer used in the sound field reproduction will
    be defined based on the new recordings."
