abstract:
- content: "New type of ICT equipment is appearing with multiple AC or up to 400 VDC
    inputs, which is impacting the power architecture inside them e.g. for inputs
    combination and power sharing e.g. for battery test. \r\nThe document describes
    all the identified impacts at the power interface i.e.switch/combine circuit between
    inputs, plugs, converter, power sharing enabling individual battery bank test,
    ... inside ICT equipment from power interface to internal converters inputs in
    the following cases:\r\n• no switch /combine upstream the converter.\r\n• AC and
    AC input to ICT equipment with switch.\r\n• DC and DC input to ICT equipment with
    combine circuit.\r\n• DC and DC input to ICT equipment with switch\r\n• Hybrid
    AC and DC input to ICT equipment with switch\r\n\r\nIt includes impacts on the
    circuit between the input interface and converter inputs, back feed protection,
    isolation, power sharing control\r\n\r\nThis WI is also submitted to ITU-T SG5/WP3
    for a joint activity."
