  content: "A standard for the thermal management of racks and cabinets defining preferred
    solutions for the removal of heat dissipated by one or more subracks in an ETSI
    rack. For example: air flow, direction of air, air velocity, permitted air temperature,
    necessity and type of air baffle. \r\nThe starting point for the standard is to
    consider the ETSI mechanical dimensions as a non-modifiable item.\r\nThe standard
    also has to define a possible preferred range for the power dissipation within
    an ETSI miscellaneous rack depending on different standardized solutions.\r\nThe
    standards should be applicable to telecommunication and ITE equipment from different
    suppliers designed for the installation in an ETSI rack."
