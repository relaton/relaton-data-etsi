abstract:
- content: "Total Conversation, as defined in ITU-T F.703, is a combination of three
    media in a conversational call: video, real-time text and audio. Total conversation
    services and terminals are deployed in the Internet in a number of countries in
    Europe, and adopted by people with disabilities who, for example, need video for
    sign language or real-time text for a text based conversation or as complement
    to a voice conversation. The objective of this Work Item is to define requirements,
    based on the backgroung described in TR 103 170, for using Total Conversation
    for emergency services and make access of emergency services possible to people
    with disabilities. The Work Item will mainly address the PSAP organisations and
    potential impact on overall organisations of emergency services.  For example
    it should address functional requirements regarding the interface to the PSAP,
    the connection to external supporting services, the transferring and sharing of
    the call between call handling organisations, the call logging and call recording,
    call back aspects and specific call routing and location information provision
    aspects for these calls.\r\nDue consideration of present ongoing standardisation
    work (e.g. 3GPP) and appropriate liaisons with relevant groups (e.g. EGEA) will
    be organised as required during the progress of this Work Item."
