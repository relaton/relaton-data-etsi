  content: "This technical report applies to control and monitoring of power systems
    for telecommunication installations and equipments. \r\nThe Telecom Management
    Network will not be fully described because energy management can be part of more
    global existing management network.\r\nGeneric interface(information) is outlined.
    \r\nThis document describes mechanism that can probably be applicable to other
    fields of equipment engineering.\r\nThe document helps to identify the type of
    information required for power system control and monitoring; it also describes
    possible solution for the supervision of heterogeneous supporting equipment."
