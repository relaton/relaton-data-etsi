  content: VoIP is growing quickly, especially in countries with a high broadband
    penetration. Therefore the use of this technology for the provision of emergency
    communication services will be considered. For this, specific features must be
    introduced such as location and routing facilities. This document gives an overview
    of activities dealing with this issue in other standardisation bodies and summarises
    different methods for VoIP providers to deliver emergency communication services.
