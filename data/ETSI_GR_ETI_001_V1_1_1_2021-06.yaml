abstract:
- content: The intent of this work item is to identify the problem of when traffic
    is encrypted and to examine how it impacts the various stakeholders. This will
    consider both positive aspects and negative impacts (e.g. end-to-end privacy and
    confidentiality versus masking of data necessary for signalling optimisation).
