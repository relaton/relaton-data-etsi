abstract:
- content: "Key AI use cases in telecom networks are (non-exaustive list): \r\n- Network
    as a service \r\n- Network optimisation \r\n- Network planning and upgrades \r\n-
    Automating security operations (anomaly detection, planning mitigation and response)
    \r\nThe use of AI to facilitate the use cases may cause AI security and privacy
    issues specific to the telecom industry. The scope of this proposed work item
    will be to investigate security and privacy issues related to the use of AI in
    the telecom industry sector. Harmonisation with 3GPP work in SA1, SA2, and SA3
    is anticipated.\r\n"
