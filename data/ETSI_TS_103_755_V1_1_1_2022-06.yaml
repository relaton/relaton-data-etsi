abstract:
- content: "The output of this work item will provide a solution that enables PEMEA
    nodes to share core ESInet components eliminating replication and supporting both
    service delivery mechanisms.\r\n\r\nParticular focus will be placed on access
    control into the \"PEMEA-ESInet zone\". Attention will also be paid to routing
    within the PEMEA-ESInet zone, bother geographic and policy-based. This will include
    clarifications and descriptions on how to use interfaces for these functions defined
    within ESInet and associated specifications.\r\n\r\nExtension to PEMEA protocol
    maybe identified as part of this work item. Such extensions may be captured in
    one of three ways listed in order below:\r\n1.\tIncluded in this work product\r\n2.\tCaptured
    in a new work item specification\r\n3.\tCaptured in a revision of the core PEMEA
    specification\r\n\r\nThe general skeleton for this work item would be as follows:\r\n\r\n•
    \ Introduction and need\r\n   o\tDirection of public communications\r\n   o\tDifferences
    between NG112 and PEMEA\r\n   \r\n•  Requirements for a solution\r\n   o\tAccess
    control\r\n   o\tCommon geo routing\r\n   o\tCommon policy routing\r\n   o\tOther\r\n
    \  \r\n•  Architectural Overview\r\n\r\n•  Component interface definitions\r\n\r\n•
    \ Methods and Procedures\r\n\r\nAnticipation of work item is over 12 months from
    initial draft document submission."
