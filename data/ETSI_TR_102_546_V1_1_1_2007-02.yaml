  content: "Identify the spectrum requirements for Professional Wireless Microphone
    Systems. These are systems  for professional audio production and are, as a rule,
    high quality wireless audio transmission systems, including, but not limited to,
    wireless microphones, back-channel equipment (in-ear monitoring), wireless equipment
    for sound mixing panels, wireless equipment for news reporting (e.g. news reporters
    and their teams), and audio link test, correction and optimization equipment.\r\nThe
    professional nature of the intended system users differentiates these systems
    from 'consumer' systems."
