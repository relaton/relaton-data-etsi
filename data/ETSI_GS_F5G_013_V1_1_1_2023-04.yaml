  content: "This Work Item will study technology requirements for F5G use cases release
    2, explore existing technologies from related SDOs, e.g. ETSI, ITU-T, IEEE, IETF,
    BBF and 3GPP. The Work Item will also perform the gap analysis between the technologies
    needed and those that are available. Finally, this Work Item will generate a complete
    technology landscape of F5G use cases release 2, comprising the existing technology
    specifications, the enhancements to those and the necessary development of new
    technology specifications. Gaps duplicated with those in Technology Landscape
    release 1 will be identified and no further recommondations are described.\r\nThis
    Work Item may produce Liaison Statements to identified SDOs to invite them to
    extend/enhance/revise their specifications or develop new ones. These Liaison
    Statements will however need to be accompaigned by contributions from common members,
    to the identified SDOs. The identification of the relevant SDOs will be based
    on their exisiting projects, Work Items and competence for each matter, thereby
    avoiding duplication of work and conflicts."
