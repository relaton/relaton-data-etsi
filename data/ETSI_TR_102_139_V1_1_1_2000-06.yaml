  content: This ETSI TEchnical report reviews technical issues on the mutual compatibility
    of current and future POTS terminal equipment with xDSL systems operating at frequencies
    up to 30 MHz. The report will consider both TE intended to support simultaneous
    operation with xDSL on the same cable pair and TE co-existing with xDSL systems
    in the same access cables.
