  content: "Recent work in the ETSI TC RT has uncovered implementation options in
    the ETSI standards for VGCS calls which must be clarified by the Railways in order
    to ensure interoperability between GSM-R networks across Europe.\r\nThis first
    release of the Technical Specification is based on what is currently mandatory,
    i.e. the document MORANE A 01 T 0004 1. \r\nA second release is planed which will
    include the conclusions of other bodies (OG, IG), e.g. CR O-9076-2.0 as well as
    some more explanations."
