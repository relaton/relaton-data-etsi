  content: The System Reference Document provides information on the intended applications,
    the technical parameters, the relation to the existing spectrum regulation and
    additional new radio spectrum requirements for road ITS applications operating
    in 5,9 GHz with channel bandwidths larger than 10 MHz. This information is to
    support potential CEPT activities in the band 5 855 MHz to 5 925 MHz for road
    ITS applications.
