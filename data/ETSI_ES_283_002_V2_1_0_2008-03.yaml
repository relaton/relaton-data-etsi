abstract:
- content: The WI will create a new version of the AGW profile. The scope of the new
    version is to cleanup omissions, flaws and provide clarifications on issues that
    have arisen due to operational experience to version 1 of the profile. An example
    of such a flaw/clarification is to better describe how ISDN p-type frames and
    f-type frames from different interfaces at the AGW to an packet handler interface
    can be distinguished and transported reliable. Additionally the profile should
    adopt the H.248.1 version 3 profile template that all the other TISPAN profiles.
