  content: "This document gives the detailed requirements for the correct operation
    of the background acoustic noise evaluation, noise parameter encoding/decoding
    and comfort noise generation for the AMR speech codec during Source Controlled
    Rate (SCR) operation.\r\nThe requirements described in this document are mandatory
    for implementation in all UEs capable of supporting the AMR speech codec.\r\nThe
    receiver requirements are mandatory for implementation in all networks capable
    of supporting the AMR speech codec, the transmitter requirements only for those
    where downlink SCR will be used.\r\nIn case of discrepancy between the requirements
    described in this document and the fixed point computational description of these
    requirements contained in [1], the description in [1] will prevail.\r\n"
