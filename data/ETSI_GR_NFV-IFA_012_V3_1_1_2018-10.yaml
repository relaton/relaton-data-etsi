abstract:
- content: "This work item will entail work to specify the use cases and the corresponding
    recommendations that will guide the evolution of the Os-Ma-nfvo reference point
    regarding applications/services on top of Network Services (NS). It will have
    close connections with the Work Items DGS/NFV-IFA010 for data modeling requirements
    and DGS/NFV-IFA013 regarding the OSS-Orchestrator interface handling of the NS.
    The impact on the NS shall be explored in the context of higher level application/service
    management where the higher level application/service is dependent on one or more
    NS(s).  Specifically, the following items will be addressed: \r\no E2E view \r\no
    Assurance \r\no Order management and Fulfillment o Inventory management \r\no
    Policy management \r\no Life cycle management of Services (applications/services
    on top of NS) \r\no Flexible/dynamic service orchestration including creation
    \ and modification (e. g. orchestration, launching of a service and adaptation
    of running services)  \r\no Real-time capabilities\r\no Automation (recovery,
    healing, etc.) \r\no Monitoring/Tracing\r\no Testing o Advanced data analytics/Big
    data including usage of several data sources   \r\no Interoperability \r\nThe
    deliverable will be informative."
