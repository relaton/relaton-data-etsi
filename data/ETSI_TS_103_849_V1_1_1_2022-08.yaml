abstract:
- content: "The scope is the standardization of the IoT system for Smart Escalators.
    \r\nIt includes :\r\n -the identification of the relevant roles;\r\n -the Information
    models in the Smart Lift system, including signals, alarms and commands; \r\n
    -the mapping to ; -the communication system (oneM2M);\r\nIt is a twin specification
    of TS 103.735 \"Smart Lift IoT System\" and it is expected to share most of the
    technical content with it in light of the similarities among lifts and escalators
    information systems. it is also expected to be linked with the ontology in  TS
    103410-11 \"SAREF for Lifts\"."
