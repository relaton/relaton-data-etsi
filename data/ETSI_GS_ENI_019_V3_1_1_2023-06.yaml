  content: The purpose of the present document is to define the ENI information model.
    The present document will also provide at least two different examples of how
    to derive technology-specific data models from the ENI information model. Finally,
    it will explain how ontologies can be incorporated to augment, enhance, and specify
    meaning and different relationships between modelled entities. This latter is
    critical to provide semantic reasoning. The present document  is specific to and
    enhances the current ENI System Architecture
