abstract:
- content: The strong role that we can foreseen for the Network Function Virtualization
    (NFV) technology will play a relevant role in the future telecommunication networks
    and will change substantially the current network architectures by introducing,
    among others, both relevant issues and opportunities with respect to energy consumption.
    For making feasible and effective the dynamic monitoring, control and management
    of energy consumption (by means, i. e., of orchestration, consolidation and management
    elements) a Southbound specific interface has to be defined. The ETSI ES 203 237
    v1.1.1 â€œEnvironmental Engineering (EE); Green Abstraction Layer (GAL) has been
    created for supporting the dynamic power management and control of current networks
    and appear to be the right candidate for this role.  But this interface has to
    be extended for correctly handle also the new structure and the new virtualized
    functionalities and this is the main objective of this that will be realized in
    strict contact with the ETSI NFV ISG activities and it will be also supported
    by the European H2020 Project INPUT. A similar work item will be also proposed
    in ITU-T SG5 for having common deliverables.
