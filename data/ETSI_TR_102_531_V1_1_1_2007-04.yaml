abstract:
- content: "Examine the opportunity for energy reduction in telecom systems by correctly
    sizing power plants an battery reserves.\r\nAt present a power plant is sized
    at the same power draw as protection equipment. This same figure is used to estimate
    yearly energy usage.\r\nPaper to show that better data on DC power consumption
    of equipment can assist in using power equipment at its most efficient loading
    and to improve energy planning."
