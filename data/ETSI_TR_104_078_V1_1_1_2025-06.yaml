  content: "The applications will be separated from the still available WI in DTR/ERM-629.
    The reasons are to prepare a clear request for ECC and to get the possibility
    to add additional frequency ranges for the application. The SRdoc will provide
    necessary application related information, such as transmitter parameters, deployment
    locations, deployment densities, usage scenarios, etc. The SRdoc will also provide
    discussions and justification on the choice of the frequency band and, if possible,
    will provide a first assessment for coexistence with existing applications.  It
    has to be noted that the frequency ranges (see title) needs to be updated at the
    end and the still available information in \tDTR/ERM-629 will be transvered to
    this work."
