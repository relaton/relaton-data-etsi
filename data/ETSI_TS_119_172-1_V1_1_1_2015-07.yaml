abstract:
- content: "To produce an EN specifying the framework (including architecture and
    relevant scenarios) required to fully address the concept and encoding of signature
    policies to be used in the management of electronic signatures within extended
    business models.\r\n\r\nThis part 1 elaborates the concept of signature policy
    documents, addressing relevant aspects of their usage and specifying their constituent
    parts. Another part will specify XML format for those parts of the signature policy
    that may be structured and are worth to be automatically processed. A third part
    will specify an ASN.1 format for the aforementioned parts."
