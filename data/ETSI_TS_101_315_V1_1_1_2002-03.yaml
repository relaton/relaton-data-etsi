abstract:
- content: "The technical specification should clarify the application of the TIPHON
    functional architecture in order to support services over several administrative
    domains. For each service, the specification will elaborate on the services functional
    layer, identifying (not necessarily defining new ones) the required service functions,
    information flows and reference points between these service functions and other
    functional entities in the service control layer, IP transport plane, Management
    plane, and SCN plane as necessary\r\n  \r\n"
