  content: "The present document provides information on the intended applications,
    the technical parameters, the relation to the existing spectrum regulation and
    additional new radio spectrum requirements for Security Scanners (SSc). The present
    document includes necessary information to support the co-operation between ETSI
    and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European Conference of
    Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT). \r\nRequirements on the devices
    for the intended applications are e.g to detect objects concealed in or underneath
    a persons clothing and to display the location of the objects on a human avatar,
    which is presented on a touchscreen. The latter is also used by an operator to
    control the SSc. An allocation within the 60 GHz to 90 GHz band with a typical
    bandwidth of 10 GHz is required.\r\n"
