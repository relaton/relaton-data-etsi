abstract:
- content: "This revision of ETSI GS NFV-SOL020 continues the development of the specification
    as part of the Release 5 and applies maintenance changes where applicable. This
    edition will also add updates according to latest published versions of the reference
    open source APIs and data model solutions related to daemon sets. The scope of
    the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nThe work item will specify
    the service interfaces to fulfill the functional requirement of the container
    infrastructure service cluster management (CIS Cluster Management, or CCM in abbreviation)
    as specified by ETSI GS NFV-IFA 036. It will analyze the NFV object model for
    CIS cluster management and the managed objects of the referenced open-source solutions
    (e.g. KubernetesÂ® cluster API) and provide a mapping between them. Based on the
    analysis results, the referenced solutions will be profiled for specifying the
    CIS cluster lifecycle, configuration, performance, fault and security management
    service interfaces. The resulting deliverable will contain normative provisions."
