abstract:
- content: Network slicing leverages NFV, SDN and cloud technologies for supporting
    a diverse range of services with very different non-functional requirements. Resiliency
    (e.g., availability, reliability) constitutes a basic attribute of network slice
    characteristics. This report will identify the guiding principles of NFV resiliency
    assurance for the support of network slicing based on an NFV infrastructure. The
    scope of this WI covers all resiliency related operational facets supporting network
    slicing. This includes design, scaling, migration, software modification, resource
    reallocation in time of scarcity, and restoration following a failure (including
    failure containment).
