  content: "To prepare Part 1, Common Requirements, of a multi-part Harmonised EN
    covering the essential requirements of transmitting equipment for terrestrial
    mobile TV to provide multimedia multicast service operating in CEPT or national
    frequency bands appropriate for this service. It is intended to cover the provisions
    of Directive 1999/5/EC (R&TTE Directive) Article 3.2, which states that: \"...
    radio equipment shall be so constructed that it effectively uses the spectrum
    allocated to terrestrial/space radio communications and orbital resources so as
    to avoid harmful interference\".\r\nThis Harmonised standard excludes from its
    scope equipment falling within the scope of EN 301 908."
