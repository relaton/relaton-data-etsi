abstract:
- content: "Core INAP for CS2 shall also reflect the Distributed Functional Plane\r\n(DFP),
    e.g. including the specification of BCSM, DP processing rules,\r\nFE modelling.
    The intention of this part of Core INAP for CS2 is, to\r\nendorse ITU-T Recommendation
    Q.1224 and to identify exceptions from\r\nQ.1224 which are valid for Core INAP
    for CS2. The service drivers and\r\nnetwork aspects which are considered in order
    to determine the\r\nexceptions from Q.1224 are the same as described in the scope
    of\r\npart 1 for th eprotocol specification of core INAP for CS2, i.e. CTM,\r\nUPT,
    CTN, GVNS, Call Party Handling (CPH), Interworking of INAP with\r\nISUP/DSS1.\r\n
    Specification of this part shall be done in close co-operation with\r\nNA 6 since
    modelling aspects are to be considered.\r\n  "
