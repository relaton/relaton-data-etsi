abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunications Standard (ETS) specifies a profile of\r\nAT
    commands and recommends that this profile be used for controlling\r\nMobile Equipment
    (ME) functions and GSM network services from a\r\nTerminal Equipment (TE) through
    Terminal Adaptor (TA). The command\r\nprefix +C is reserved for Digital Cellular
    in ITU-T Recommendation\r\nV.25ter [14]. This ETS has also the syntax details
    used to construct\r\nthese extended GSM commands. Commands from ITU-T Recommendation
    V.25te\r\n[14] and existing digital cellular standards (TIA IS-99 [15] and TIA\r\nIS-135
    [16]) are used whenever applicable. Some of the new commands ar\r\ndefined such
    way that they can be easily applied to ME of networks\r\nother than GSM. ITU-T
    T.31 [11] and T.32 [12] fax AT commands may be\r\nused for GSM fax transmission
    from TE. GSM Short Message Service AT\r\ncommands are defined in GSM 07.05 [24].\r\nThis
    ETS assumes an abstract architecture comprising a TE (e.g. a\r\ncomputer) and
    a ME interfaced by a TA (see figure 1). The span of\r\ncontrol of the defined
    commands should allow to handle any physical\r\nimplementation that this abstract
    architecture may lead to:\r\n- TA, ME and TE as three separate entities;\r\n-
    TA integrated under the ME cover, and the TE implemented as a\r\nseparate entity;\r\n-
    TA integrated under the TE cover, and the ME implemented as a\r\nseparate entity;\r\n-
    TA and ME integrated under the TE cover as a single entity.\r\n The commands described
    in this ETS may be observed on the link between\r\nthe TE and the TA. However,
    most of the commands retrieve information\r\nabout the ME, not about the TA.\r\n"
