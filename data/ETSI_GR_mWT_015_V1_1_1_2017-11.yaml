  content: "Purpose of this work item is informative to produce an overview on Bands
    or/and Carrier Aggregation systems (BCA) in fixed service operating in same or
    different frequency bands (considering both microwave  and millimetre wave spectrum)
    \r\n- Definition of BCA system and possible arrangements \r\n- Relevant applications
    and use cases identification\r\n- Main requirements expected from use cases \r\n-
    Network planning analysis \r\n- Overview and analysis on regulation and  provisions
    given in today Regulations and administration approach \r\n- Identification of
    corrective actions if any."
