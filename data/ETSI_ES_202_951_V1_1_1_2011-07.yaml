abstract:
- content: This document shall identify and collect all relevant concepts that model
    specifications developed primarily for testing should include. Its intent is to
    enable MBT tools to automatically generate test specifications suitable for standardization
    from such models, i.e., test specifications in a format similar to the one written
    by hand today. Concepts are to be specified independent of a specific modelling
    language. Mappings of concepts to concrete modelling languages may be provided
    in future versions in the Annex of the document.
