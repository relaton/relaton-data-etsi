abstract:
- content: "This deliverable will support manufacturers by offering them guidance
    with respect to understanding how risk assessment and risk reduction in the field
    of articles 3(1)(b) (EMC) and 3(2) (effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum)
    of the Radio Equipment Directive (RED) 2014/53/EU may be carried out, preferably
    based on input from the experts within Technical Committees in ETSI.\r\n\r\nThe
    conformity assessment procedures applicable to radio equipment requests manufacturers
    an adequate analysis and assessment of the risk(s) related to the fulfilling of
    the essential requirements of the RED. Blue Guide 2016 and the RED Guide, provide
    guidance on risk assessment, but manufacturers need more information on how to
    carry on such a risk assessment and how to lower the risks.\r\n\r\nCENELEC has
    already published the CENELEC GUIDE 32: Guidelines for Safety Related Risk Assessment
    and Risk Reduction for Low Voltage Equipment which is applicable to the risk assessment
    and risk reduction related to article 3(1)a (electrical safety and health) of
    the RED. Cooperation should be seeked with CENELEC for the development of the
    EMC risk assessment methodology.\r\n\r\nRisk assessment and risk reduction in
    the field of RED article 3(3) (additional essential requirements for radio equipment
    within certain categories or classes, such as privacy, cybersecurity) is excluded
    from this deliverable. \r\n\r\nFollowing groups could also be involved in this
    work item : RED CA, EUANB, ADCO RED and EMC ADCO."
