  content: "Modulation and channel coding system for the distribution of digital\r\nmulti-programme
    Television (TV)/High Definition Television (HDTV) by\r\nMultipoint Video Distribution
    Systems (MVDS) below 10 GHz.\r\nThe System described in this ETS is based on that
    described in\r\nETS 300 429 on framing structure, channel coding and modulation\r\nfor
    cable systems.\r\nThe frequency band may/will be harmonised within CEPT.\r\nThe
    System is suitable for use on different MVDS transmitter\r\nbandwidths.\r\nCompatibility
    with Moving Pictures Experts Group-2 (MPEG-2) coded TV\r\nservices (see ISO/IEC
    IS 13818-1), with a transmission structure\r\nsynchronous with the packet multiplex,
    is provided.  Exploitation of\r\nthe multiplex flexibility allows the use of the
    transmission capacity\r\nfor a variety of TV service configurations, including
    sound and data\r\nservices.  All service components are Time Division Multiplexed
    (TDM)\r\non a single digital carrier.\r\n  "
