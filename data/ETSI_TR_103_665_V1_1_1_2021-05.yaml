  content: 'The System Reference Document will be developed in response to the request
    from WGFM as in document FM(19)075-Annex 48 and will cover the following: (1)
    A description of possible new systems using Wide Band technologies operating at
    100 mW eirp within the 2.4 GHz band which may not fit within the current Annex
    3 of ERC/REC 70.03. The new systems will use a polite access/sharing mechanism
    to facilitate coexistence with other systems currently already within the scope
    of Annex 3 of ERC/REC 70.03.  (2) To provide technical characteristics of existing
    systems and technologies that had been developed compliant with the current provisions
    in Annex 3 of ERC/REC 70.03. The objective is to provide the technical characteristics
    of the major systems currently using the 2.4 GHz band (e.g. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
    Zigbee, ..) and using Annex 3 of ERC/REC 70.03 which will allow the CEPT to do
    a proper coexistence study for the new proposed systems referred to under (1).
    The document will  include the necessary information to support the co-operation
    between ETSI and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European
    Conference of Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT).'
