abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 049 continues the development of the specification
    as part of the NFV Release 5. This edition will add requirements to support the
    Release 5 features. The scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-IFA
    049 specifies: \r\nRegarding the VNF generic OAM functions and other PaaS Services,
    it specifies the functional requirements and the interface requirements for VNF
    generic OAM functions and other PaaS Services. Specification of the interfaces
    exposed by the VNF generic OAM functions and other PaaS Services, and the relevant
    information models are also provided, like also a description of requirements
    and modelling of descriptors of PaaS Services, with specific additional requirements
    for VNF generic OAM functions.\r\nRegarding the PaaS Service management, it specifies
    interface requirements of interfaces produced by the PSM and PSR (as functionally
    specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 010), and their interface operations and associated
    information modelling.\r\n"
