abstract:
- content: The work item will specify new capabilities (so called security capabilities)
    of the ZSM framework architecture to support automatic/zero-touch security controls
    for ZSM framework to align with zero-touch objective, applicable end-to-end and
    per management domain.  The set of security capabilities will be specified as
    management services, complementing the existing management services defined in
    ETSI GS ZSM 002 V1.1.1, and will focus on automatic security governance of management
    service/function including AI/ML enabled service/function, adaptive trust relationship
    between management domains,  dynamic access control and exposure of ZSM service,
    as well as supporting intelligent security services built on capabilities of ZSM
    framework.  The work item will also document deployment aspects of the security
    scenarios to validate the applicability of the security requirements and management
    services/functions.  Related work from standard development organizations, open
    source projects and other sources will be considered and re-used, where applicable,
    in the development of the specifications.
