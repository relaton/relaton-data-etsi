abstract:
- content: "This draft European Telecommunication Standard (ETS)  gives a\r\ndescription
    of the general baseband operation of enhanced full rate\r\nspeech traffic channels
    in the transmitter and in the receiver of GSM\r\nMobile Stations and Base Station
    Systems during Discontinuous\r\nTransmission (DTX).\r\n For clarity, the description
    is structured according to the block\r\ndiagrams in figures 1 and 4. Except in
    the case described next, this\r\nstructure of distributing the various functions
    between  system\r\nentities is not mandatory for implementation, as long as the
    operation\r\non the air interface and on the speech decoder output remains the\r\nsame.\r\n
    In the case of BSSs where the speech transcoder is located remotely in\r\nthe
    Base Station Controller (BSC), the implementation of the\r\ninterfaces between
    the DTX handlers and the Radio Sub System (RSS) as\r\ndescribed in this draft
    ETS together with all their flags is\r\nmandatory, being part of the A-bis interface
    as described in GSM\r\n08.61.\r\n The DTX functions described in this technical
    specification are\r\nmandatory for implementation in the GSM MSs. The receiver
    requirements\r\nare mandatory for implementation in all GSM BSSs, the transmitter\r\nrequirements
    only for those where downlink DTX will be used.\r\n"
