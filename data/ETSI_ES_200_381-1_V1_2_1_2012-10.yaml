  content: "This revision of the ETS 300 381 is needed for several reasons: the test
    methods of handsets and earphones have been changed since the creation of the
    initial ETS(December 1994); the types of telephone that shall be covered by this
    revised ES have evolved and some more recent types are missing; the needs  for
    an ETSI reference document to be also used in DEN 301549 currently under development.\r\nThe
    input from the correspondence will be taken into account before approval of the
    deliverable\r\n"
