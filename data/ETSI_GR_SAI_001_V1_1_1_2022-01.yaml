abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this work item is to define what would be considered an
    AI threat and how it might differ from threats to traditional systems. The starting
    point that offers the rationale for this work is that currently, there is no common
    understanding of what constitutes an attack on AI and how it might be created,
    hosted and propagated.\r\nThe AI Threat Ontology deliverable will seek to align
    terminology across the different stakeholders and multiple industries. This document
    will define what is meant by these terms in the context of cyber and physical
    security and with an accompanying narrative that should be readily accessible
    by both experts and less informed audiences across the multiple industries. Note
    that this threat ontology will address AI as system, an adversarial attacker,
    and as a system defender,"
