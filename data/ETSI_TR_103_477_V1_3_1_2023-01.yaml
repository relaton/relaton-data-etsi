  content: 'To present a number of typical use cases in the eHealth domain and from
    their analysis to identify gaps in standardisation. The analysis should cover
    aspects of link connectivity, network interconnectivity, semantic and syntactic
    interoperability, security (risks and provisions), and the existence of standards
    to meet each aspect. Furthermore the analysis should clearly identify actors and
    their roles, for each of primary, secondary and tertiary involvement in the use
    case. Examples will be sought from industry, from existing and completed FP7 and
    H2020 projects and from current eHealth and Health industry practices. '
