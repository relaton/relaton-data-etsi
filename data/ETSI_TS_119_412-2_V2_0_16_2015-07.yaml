abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies requirements on the content of certificates
    issued to natural persons.This profile builds on RFC 5280 for generic profiling
    of X.509 | ISO/IEC 9594-8.  \r\nThis profile supports the requirements of EU qualified
    certificates as specified in the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 [i.8] as well as
    other forms of certificate.The scope of the present document is primary limited
    to facilitate interoperable processing and display of certificate information.
    This profile therefore excludes support for some certificate information content
    options, which can be perfectly valid in a local context but which are not regarded
    as relevant or suitable for use in widely deployed applications.\r\nThe present
    document focuses on requirements on certificate content. Requirements on decoding
    and processing rules are limited to aspects required to process certificate content
    defined in the present document. Further processing requirements are only specified
    for cases where it adds information that is necessary for the sake of interoperability.
    \ \r\nCertain applications or protocols impose specific requirements on certificate
    content. The present document is based on the assumption that these requirements
    are adequately defined by the respective application or protocol. It is therefore
    outside the scope of the present document to specify such application or protocol
    specific certificate content.\r\n"
