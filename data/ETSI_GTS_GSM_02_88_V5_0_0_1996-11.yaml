abstract:
- content: "This Global System for Mobile communications Technical Specification (\r\nGTS)
    describes the supplementary services belonging to the group Call\r\nRestriction
    Supplementary Services.\r\nThe general aspects - including definitions and recommended
    provision\r\n- of the description of the GSM supplementary services are given
    in GS\r\nM 02.04.\r\nThe Call Restriction supplementary services allow the possibility
    for\r\na mobile subscriber to have barring of certain categories of outgoing\r\nor
    incoming calls at the mobile subscribers access.\r\nThe group of Call Restriction
    Services includes two supplementary serv\r\nices:\r\n- barring of outgoing calls;\r\n-
    barring of incoming calls.\r\n By use of subscription options, the mobile subscriber
    can at provision\r\ntime select a set of one or more barring programs to determine
    the ca\r\ntegories of calls to be barred. The following categories are defined:\r\n-all
    outgoing calls;\r\n-outgoing international calls;\r\n-outgoing international calls
    except those directed to the home PLMN\r\ncountry;\r\n-all incoming calls;\r\n-incoming
    calls when roaming outside the home PLMN country.\r\n NOTE 1:Each category (barring
    program) is handled as a single supplem\r\nentary service.\r\nNOTE 2:The call
    barring program \"incoming calls when roaming outside\r\nthe home PLMN country\"
    is only relevant if as a general rule the calle\r\nd mobile subscriber pays the
    charges for the forwarded part of the cal\r\nl from his home PLMN country to any
    other country.\r\nThe barring services can be offered to a mobile subscriber with
    a pass\r\nword option allowing the activation and deactivation by the subscriber.
    One password per mobile subscriber is supported by the network for a ll barring
    services. For the definition of the password, the description of its use and its
    management, see GSM 02.04 b"
