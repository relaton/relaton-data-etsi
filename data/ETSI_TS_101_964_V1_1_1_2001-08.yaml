  content: The Control Channel specification for SMATV/MATV distribution systems (based
    on EN 300 743) is intended to provide remote control of the head-end device from
    the user's terminal through a set of commands in a closed in-building environment
    for the delivery of broadcast services. Provision for interactive services is
    out of the scope of this specification.
