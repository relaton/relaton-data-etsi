abstract:
- content: 'The WI will identify and describe additional use cases and scenarios that
    are enabled with enhanced experience, through the use of network intelligence.
    The use cases and scenarios will detail where the intelligence can be applied
    in the fixed network, mobile network, or both. The specification will give the
    baseline on how the studies in ENI can be applied as solutions of the identified
    use cases in accordance with the ENI Reference Architecture, and will substantially
    benefit the operators and other stakeholders.  '
