  content: "The aim of this work is to widen and simplify end user access to mobile
    information and communication devices and services. The document will be based
    on consensus and best practice, addressing key issues from the end user's perspective.
    It will provide guidance to ETSI, manufacturers and service providers on possible
    and beneficiary options to harmonize generic UI elements for mobile ICT terminal
    devices and services, on the basic level, without limiting their options to use
    the user experience of brand-specific user interface implementations as a competitive
    edge. \r\nIn order to support the trend toward mobile access to ICT for all, basic
    needs and goals of users of mobile telecommunication terminals and services will
    be examined in detail, taking into account all users (e.g. novice users, professional
    users, the mobile worker, young, elderly and disabled people). Based on this analysis,
    a core set of common user interface solutions of key functions will be identified
    and recommended for harmonisation, without restricting the ability of market players
    to further develop their devices and services. Also, negative aspects of such
    a harmonisation will be considered.\r\nThe work will address areas such as basic
    call handling and safety-critical functionality, configuration and access to network-based
    functionality and services (including some professional application areas), most
    common and basic symbols and icons and specific support for the young and elderly
    users.\r\nResults of work performed by ETSI TC HF through other STFs under the
    eEurope 2002 Initiative will be considered and included in order to make an implementation-oriented
    practical impact. \r\n"
