  content: "1) The definition of a reference board in order to perform EMC tests to
    investigate the EMC interaction between the UICC and the ME with respect to unsynchronised
    oscillators on the UICC.\r\n2) The definition of a test card with a SIM application
    in order to establish the correlation between the reference and the final system
    (GSM, WCDMA, ..).\r\nThe aim of the test card is to include as many possible silicon
    / module implementation intended to be used by the card manufacturer for UICC.\r\nThe
    most important requirements are:\r\n- The test card shall be able to operate with
    an existing GSM system simulator.\r\n- The test card shall be able to enable the
    worst cases of all consumption modes which are used in the application software.\r\nThe
    consumption modes could be defined as follows:\r\n- Execute Code in NVM (endless
    loop), don't use additional hardware (peripherals).\r\n- Execute Code in NVM (endless
    loop), use hardware peripherals, e.g. cryptographic modules (endless loop) which
    are also used within the real application.\r\n- All available clock modes (e.g.
    direct mode, multiplication modes, free running modes) shall be selectable.\r\n-
    Program NVM (endless loop).\r\n- Clock stop mode shall be also supported.\r\nA
    documentation of the relation between the several clock modes (internal used frequency)
    and the power consumption is to be elaborated.\r\nThe time scale estimated for
    this task is 6 - 9 months."
