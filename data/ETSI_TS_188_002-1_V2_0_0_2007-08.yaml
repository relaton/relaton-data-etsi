abstract:
- content: "The subscription management is necessary to allow Service Providers and
    Operators to provision, control, and monitor and bill the configuration of services
    that they offer to their subscribers.\r\nThis WI deals with subscription management
    and focuses on the following topics: \r\n-Define an end-to-end data model to cover
    all the mandatory/optional information related to subscription management that
    must be provisioned on the NGN Network. \r\n-Define a subscription management
    architecture which hides the complexity of the different nodes to be configured
    including the CPE and the AS.\r\nAll relevant standards for subscription management
    should be considered as input."
