abstract:
- content: 'This work item will explore issues around combining classical and post-quantum
    algorithms to construct hybrid cryptographic schemes.  Specifically, this technical
    report will: examine some of the reasons for proposing and adopting hybrid schemes,
    both for key establishment and digital signatures; clarify some of the terminology
    used to describe hybrid schemes; discuss some of the security, efficiency, and
    agility trade-offs; highlight some important things to consider when selecting
    algorithm and parameter combinations; explore some potential deployment and migration
    issues; and identify situations where hybrid schemes will need to be deprecated
    in favour of purely post-quantum algorithms.'
