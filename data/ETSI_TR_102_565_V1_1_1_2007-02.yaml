  content: "Technical report would:\r\n- clarify the standardization aspects for P-P
    Fixed Radio Systems mainly designed for packet data transmission and which may
    apply flexible operation modes (e.g. modulation/coding combinations) applicable
    to existiing RF-channel plans recommended by CEPT of ITU.\r\n- additionally possibilities
    for multiple or mixed network interfaces and\r\n- implications on IP/ATM networks
    would be clarified."
