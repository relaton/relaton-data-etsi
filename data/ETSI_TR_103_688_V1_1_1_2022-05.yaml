abstract:
- content: "To review requirements on the receiver sensitivity, adjacent channel rejection
    and the alternate adjacent channel rejection (referred to as “receiver requirements”
    in the following) in EN 302 571 with the aim\r\n•\tTo identify technical or operational
    needs for tightening current limits for receiver requirements in EN 302 571, and
    if yes, to which extent.\r\n•\tTo assess the feasibility of defining such receiver
    requirements and associated tests for demonstrating compliance in a technology
    neutral manner. \r\n•\tIf not feasible, to specify alternative receiver requirements
    and associated tests for demonstrating compliance."
