abstract:
- content: "This draft European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) defines a frame\r\nsubstitution
    and muting procedure which shall be used by the Receive\r\n(RX) Discontinuous
    Transmission (DTX) handler when one or more lost\r\nspeech or Silence Descriptor
    (SID) frames are received from the Radio\r\nSub System (RSS).\r\nThe requirements
    of this ETS are mandatory for implementation in all\r\nGSM Base Station Systems
    (BSS)s and Mobile Stations (MS)s capable of\r\nsupporting the enhanced full-rate
    speech traffic channel. It is not\r\nmandatory to follow the bit exact implementation
    outlined in this\r\nspecification and the corresponding C-source code.\r\n"
