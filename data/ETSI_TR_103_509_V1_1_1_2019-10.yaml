    based on a limited set of use cases and from available existing data models.\r\nThis
    work is expected to be developed in close collaboration with AIOTI and the H2020
    Large Scale Pilots, and with ETSI activities (in particular EP eHealth). \r\nFurther
    extensions are envisaged in the future to cover entirely the eHealth/Ageing-well
    domain."
