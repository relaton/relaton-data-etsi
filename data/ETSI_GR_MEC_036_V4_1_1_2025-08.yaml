abstract:
- content: 'This work item will study how terminal units, mobile hosts and personal
    devices can be used to support cloud computing at the edge. The study will focus
    on these aspects:    • Limited availability of compute resources for running MEC
    applications and its impact on life cycle management of VMs, Containers or other
    form of virtual instances. • Mobility of constrained terminals impacting reachability
    of  MEC applications, maintenance of reasonable connectivity, device availability
    and discovery of appropriate services. • Impact of unavailability of reliable
    high bandwidth backhaul connectivity (e.g. wired or wireless).  • Security and
    authorization to use a constrained terminal, privacy of user data   Applicability
    of MEC Specification to support cloud computing on such constrained environment
    will be studied. Firstly, we will document the use cases for such constrained
    cloud environment. Secondly, we will analyse the current specifications. Thirdly,
    we will clarify the requirement and missing parts. Finally, we will indicate possible
    solutions to close the gaps, if any. The work item will consider developments
    of other standard/industry bodies such as 3GPP, GSMA, 5GAA, LF and all relevant
    work done in ETSI.'
