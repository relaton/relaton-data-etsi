  content: "This Global System for Mobile communications Technical Specification (\r\nGTS)
    identifies the interworking functions and requirements to support\r\nPacket Assembly/Disassembly
    (PAD) services in the PLMN.\r\nGSM 09.05 applies to PAD access in order to provide
    communications wit\r\nh host systems connected to Packet Switched Public Data
    Network (PSPDN\r\n) for Mobile Stations (MS)s.\r\nWithin this GTS, the requirements
    for accessing an existing PAD in a P\r\nSPDN (basic PAD access) or accessing a
    dedicated PAD are considered se\r\nparately. In each case, the general problem
    of charging is examined.\r\nThis GTS considers only the access by a MS to a PAD
    and not the revers\r\ne access (i.e. only mobile originated calls are supported).\r\n "
