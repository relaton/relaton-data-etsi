abstract:
- content: This Work Item will describe use cases for the F5G Advanced network, which
    will complement the GR F5G 020. The use cases include services and applications
    to consumers, enterprises, vertical industries, operational optimizations, and
    evolved fixed end-to-end infrastructure.  Use cases will be aimed to introduce
    new technical requirements for the F5G Advance Network along various characteristic
    dimensions. The use cases will be used as input for gap analysis and technology
    landscape activities to extract technical requirements.
