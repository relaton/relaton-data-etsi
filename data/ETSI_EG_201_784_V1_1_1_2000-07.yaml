abstract:
- content: "The Guide for maritime EMC parameters should include the necessary information
    in order to be used as a generic EMC standard for maritime radio communication
    equipment but should also indicate how the EMC requirements could be integrated
    with the radiotechnical parameters.  Further, the EG should also indicate in which
    parts of a standard parameters which have both radiosystem as well as EMC nature,
    such as spurious emissions, should be placed.\r\n"
