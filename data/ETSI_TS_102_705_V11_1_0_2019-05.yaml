abstract:
- content: " The present document describes the UICC Application Programming Interface
    for Java Card™ for contactless Applications. Its purpose is to provide access
    for a contactless Applet to the services provided by the HCI protocol defined
    in [4] for the communication via the CLF. In the scope of the present document
    contactless means support for the RF Technologies referenced by the HCI specification
    [4]. Low level functionality to manage gates and pipes as defined in the HCI specification
    [4] is not in the scope of the present document. \r\n"
