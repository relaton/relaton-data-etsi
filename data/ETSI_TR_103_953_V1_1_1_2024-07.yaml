abstract:
- content: "TLMSP (ETSI TS 103 523-2) is a feature-rich protocol and it could be unclear
    to some users how to configure it in different scenarios, i.e. when different
    application layer protocols are used, and when used for different services. A
    TR providing guidelines on the following topics is proposed:\r\n1.\thow to map
    different parts (such as header fields, sub-parts of payload, etc) of the application
    layer protocol onto different TLMSP contexts,\r\n2.\thow to assign access rights
    (read/write/delete/insert) to those contexts, \r\n3.\trecommendations on usage
    of deletions and insertions by authorized middleboxes, \r\n4.\tsuitable format
    and content of TLMSP audit containers, \r\n5.\thow to (in more specific detail)
    \r\na.\tapply dynamic discovery of middleboxes,\r\nb.\tuse the TLMSP alternative
    modes (TLS-fallback and TLMSP-proxying).\r\n\r\nIn particular the items 2-5 will
    depend not only on the application protocol, but also on specifics of the service
    running over that protocol such as the type/functionality of middleboxes present,
    security threats, relevant security policies, etc.\r\nAs the work progresses,
    other topics could be included, as identified.\r\n\r\nExamples of application
    layer protocols in scope include at least: HTTP, …\r\nExamples of services in
    scope includes at least: external access into corporate network, internet access
    from inside corporate network, data center usage, malware protection,…\r\n"
