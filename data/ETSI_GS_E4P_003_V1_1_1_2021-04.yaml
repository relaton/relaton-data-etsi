abstract:
- content: This document specifies the requirements for Pandemic Contact Tracing Systems
    using mobile devices. The use cases  are defined addressing the key aspects of
    the system (reliability, accuracy, timeliness, privacy, security etc.) and reflecting
    the conclusions of GR “Comparison of existing pandemic contact tracing systems”.
    The relevant EU guidelines/requirements and a balance of trade-offs are considered,
    with the aim of achieving systems which are practical to deploy, will be used
    by the majority of users voluntarily, are compliant with the applicable laws and
    regulations, and provide seamless continuity of pandemic contact tracing for people
    travelling between countries.
