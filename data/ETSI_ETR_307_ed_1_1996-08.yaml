  content: "This ETR provides a current overview of work recognized as already\r\ndone
    or in progress within the ETSI TC TM on issues covering the\r\nSynchronous Digital
    Hierarchy (SDH) and also it searches for\r\ncompatibility with other future, current
    and past technologies and\r\nhierarchies. The ETR shall in future describe all
    SDH aspects to be\r\nstandardized and their relationship to appropriate work items
    (WIs),\r\nand already published standards (ETSs) and reports (ETRs).\r\n Also
    work done in other Technical Commitees with aspects of SDH or\r\nimpact on SDH
    shall be considered and harmonized. The TC recognized\r\nto be standardizing Architecture,
    Protocols, and Interfaces being on\r\nthe boundary with SDH or using SDH networks
    are: NA, BTC, and TE.\r\n NOTE:\tThe TC list is exhaustive and will be updated
    with any new TC\r\nrecognized.\r\n"
