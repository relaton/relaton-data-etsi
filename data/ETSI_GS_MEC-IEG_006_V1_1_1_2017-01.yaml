    the improvements enabled by MEC. It will include best practice and guidelines
    on how to evaluate the results. In order to evaluate the improvements in selected
    use cases / service scenarios, it may also include examples of achieved and/or
    desired ranges of performances (e.g. end-to-end latency, energy efficiency, etc.).
    The scope of the WI covers both LTE-based and future mobile networks. \r\nThe
