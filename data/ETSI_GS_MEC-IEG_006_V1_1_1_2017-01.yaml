  content: "This Work Item (WI) will provide recommendations on metrics to measure
    the improvements enabled by MEC. It will include best practice and guidelines
    on how to evaluate the results. In order to evaluate the improvements in selected
    use cases / service scenarios, it may also include examples of achieved and/or
    desired ranges of performances (e.g. end-to-end latency, energy efficiency, etc.).
    The scope of the WI covers both LTE-based and future mobile networks. \r\nThe
    expected deliverable is: Group Specification of MEC Metrics Best Practices and
    Guidelines\r\n"
