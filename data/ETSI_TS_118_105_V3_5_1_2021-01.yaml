  content: "Specify oneM2M Protocols & APIs for management specific to individual
    management technologies (e.g., OMA DM, BBF TR-069, LWM2M).\r\nThe specification(s)
    will cover:\r\n Per individual management technology, specifying the usage of
    the management related resources and the message flows including normal cases
    as well as error cases to fulfil the management related requirements defined in
    requirements TS over the Mca, Mcc and Mcn reference point.\r\n- Mapping of oneM2M
    management related resources to the resources from individual management technologies
    (e.g., OMA DM, BBF TR-069, LWM2M resources).\r\n- Protocol translation from oneM2M
    service layer to the individual management technologies. The Mca reference point,
    ms interface and la interface are possibly involved in this protocol translation.\r\nNote:
    since the ms interface and la interface have not been specified, this can impact
    the work of the protocol translation.\r\nPotential resource definitions for the
    individual management technologies to fulfil the oneM2M management requirements.\r\n"
