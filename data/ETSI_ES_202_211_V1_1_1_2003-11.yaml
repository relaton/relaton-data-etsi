  content: " ES 201 108 v1.1.2 defines the standard for a Distributed Speech Recognition
    front-end using Mel-Cepstrum features. The purpose of this new work item is to
    enable improved performance for tonal language recognition and provide the ability
    to reconstruct a speech waveform from the DSR parameters. To achieve this additional
    parameters(less than 1kbit/s) containing fundamental frequency information for
    the speech will be transmitted to supplement the 4.8kbit of data sent for the
    cepstral features.\r\nThis standard will define the encoder to be used to create
    the additional parameters to be sent, the compression of these parameters and
    the decoder that can generate a speech waveform from them.\r\nThe analysis performed
    at the encoder will provide fundamental frequency information that is suitable
    for use in speech recognition systems for tonal languages. The processing that
    will be used to create the tonal feature parameters eventually used by a recogniser
    is not part of this standard. The decoding of the received parameters together
    with the DSR cepstra to recreate a speech waveform will also be defined within
    this workitem and become a standard."
