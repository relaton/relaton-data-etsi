abstract:
- content: This GR will provide a summary of the oneM2M and MEC implementations that
    have been investigated as part of STF 685 Enabling Standardized IoT deployments
    in MEC Environments for advanced systems. It will include a list of the use case
    selection criteria and assessment of implementations for use in the PoCs. It will
    include an evaluation of the existing features that are needed as well as an assessment
    of development effort required to implement any identified potential new features.
    Finally, it will indicate the selected implementations and the reasons for their
    selection.
