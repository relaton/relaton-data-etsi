abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this Group Specification is the (preliminary) definition
    of a standard API for Context Information Management (CIM-API) enabling close
    to real-time access to information coming from many different sources (not only
    IoT). The document shall define how such an API enables applications to perform
    updates on context, register context providers which can be queried to get updates
    on context, query information on current and historic context information and
    subscribe for receiving notifications on context changes. The criteria for choice
    of the API characteristics shall be based on results in WI UC and WI GAP.\r\nThis
    Group Specification is labelled \"preliminary\" because it should be published
    widely in order to elicit comment and critique from the user communities and their
    comments will be used to modify and improve the later final API specification.
    Accordingly a feedback process shall be described in this document.\r\nThis Group
    Specification shall be compatible with an example data model published at the
    same time (see Work Item MOD0), so that implementers of appropriate software can
    efficiently test and compare results and interoperability.  "
