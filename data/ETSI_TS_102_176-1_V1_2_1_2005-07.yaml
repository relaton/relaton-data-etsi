abstract:
- content: "This document defines an initial set of algorithms and the corresponding
    parameters to be included in a list of approved methods for producing or verifying
    Electronic Signatures during the signature creation and validation process and
    environment, in trusted CSP components and other technical components and related
    areas.\r\nThe purpose of the WI is to provide common specifications to be referenced
    by the set of standards, which cover systems and services involving electronic
    signatures. The standards addressed in the first place are the EESSI deliverables
    by ETSI and CEN. The objective of the specification is to provide for technical
    interoperability and for consistency of cryptographic strength of electronic signatures
    used within those systems and services. \r\nThe document defines a list of approved
    cryptographic algorithms combined with the requirements on their parameters, as
    well as the approved combinations of algorithms in the form of \"signature suites\".
    To support the management activities, a numbering scheme for cryptographic algorithms
    and their parameters is defined.\r\nPart 1 will be targeted to define a list of
    cryptographic algorithms together with the requirements on their parameters, as
    well as the recommended combinations of algorithms in the form of \"signature
    suites\" to be used with the data structures defined in the documents developed
    under the EESSI (European Electronic Signature Standardization Initiative)."
