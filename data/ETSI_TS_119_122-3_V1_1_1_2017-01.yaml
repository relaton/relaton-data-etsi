abstract:
- content: "To generate: \r\n1) The specification of mechanisms able to incorporate
    Evidence Record Syntax (RFC 4998 and RFC 6283) within a CAdES signature as an
    alternative Proof Of Existence to archive-time-stamp-v3.\r\n2) The specification
    of how the new mechanisms will be managed for being incorporated to CAdES signatures
    incorporating archive-time-stamp-v3 will be specified. \r\n3) The specification
    of how the new mechanisms will be managed for being incorporated to legacy CAdES
    signatures incorporating long-term-validation attributes or previous versions
    archive time-stamp attributes will be specified.  Also to include  the new aforementioned
    mechanisms into the repertoire of CAdES levels signatures already defined (this
    can imply the definition of a new level)."
