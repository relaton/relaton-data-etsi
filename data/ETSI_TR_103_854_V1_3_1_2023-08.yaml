  content: "The present document describes interfaces which consist of requests (from
    a Law Enforcement Agency system) for vehicle-related data, and the responses (e.g.
    from an industry system) to those requests. The present document describes some
    usage scenarios, and also puts forward some examples for this interface. The present
    document includes a recommendation for the details of how the LEA/Industry interface
    could work.\r\nThis revision is to provide an update to the annex and example
    questions."
