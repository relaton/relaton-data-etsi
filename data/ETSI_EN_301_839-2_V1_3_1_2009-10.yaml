abstract:
- content: The present document specifies requirements for ULP-AMI and peripherals
    including specific requirements for LBT and operating channel selection which
    external devices must use to select clear spectrum for a communications session.  It
    is proposed to provide additional provisions to allow implanted devices to perform
    the LBT and operating channel selection functions for communications between implanted
    devices.
