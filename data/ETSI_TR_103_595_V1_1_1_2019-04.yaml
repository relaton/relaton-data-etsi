abstract:
- content: 'The document will provide information on the existing and intended applications,
    the technical parameters, the relation to the existing spectrum regulation (ECC/DEC/(11)02
    and 2017/1483/EU).The current regulation should be reviewed in the light of half
    sphere concept and the needs from the market. This document will for example request
    a more flexible approach for the current requirement of a strict downwards pointing
    directional antenna. The document will include necessary information to support
    the co-operation between ETSI and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC)
    of the European Conference of Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT),
    including: • Detailed market information (annex A); • Technical information (annex
    B); • Relation to existing spectrum regulation (annex C); • Expected compatibility
    issues (annex D).'
