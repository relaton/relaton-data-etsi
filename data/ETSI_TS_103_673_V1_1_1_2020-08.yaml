abstract:
- content: To define the development workflow of SAREF based on the ETSI forge. The
    development workflow defines the different types of issues (labels), the development
    workflow (branches and merge requests) and the decision process for accepting
    merge requests by the SmartM2M. This deliverable will enable the SAREF developers
    to speed up the development of SAREF and its extensions.
