  content: 'Scope of work to be undertaken: This feasibility study collects possible
    requirements for the spectrum utilization of Cognitive radio and Software Defined
    Radio Systems including but not limited to possible regulatory implications. Based
    on such system requirements the identification of candidate topics for standardization
    at ETSI is the key target of this study including also a survey of related activities
    in other SDOs .'
