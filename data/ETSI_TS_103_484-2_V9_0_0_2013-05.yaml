  content: "This Work Item will deliver new conformance test specifications verifying
    requirements specified in TS 102 484 and TS 102 221. One multi-part test specification
    will be produced, addressing the Terminal aspects and the UICC aspects.\r\n\r\nThese
    aspects include the architecture, functional capabilities and characteristics
    of the Secure Channel protocol and its associated interfaces transported over
    the legacy UICC interface specified in TS 102 221. \r\n\r\nThe delivered content
    shall be extendable to the implementation of the Secure Channel over the USB UICC
    interface specified in TS 102 600 as well as the Platform to Platform mode of
    operation. The addition of test cases related to TS 102 600 and Platform to Platform
    are planned for a later stage. \r\n\r\nThis work item will focus on those aspects
    of TS 102 484 and TS 102 221 which are used by customer organisations like 3GPP
    and OMA BCAST. \r\n\r\nThe scope of work to be undertaken covers the following:\r\nCollection
    of conformance requirements specified for Secure Channel in TS 102 484 and TS
    102 221 (Requirements Capturing)\r\nDefinition of the test environment and the
    test methods\r\nSpecification of test cases for the \r\noSecured APDU - Application
    to Application\r\noKey agreement (Pre-shared Keys)\r\nSupporting companies:\r\nCOMPRION,\r\nIlluminismo,\r\nNOKIA,\r\nSagem
    Orga GmbH,\r\nVALID\r\nThe WID description is found in SCP(11)0176r1"
