abstract:
- content: "The characteristics of 'adaptive networks' such as virtualization, self-organization,
    self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing and self-learning offer huge
    advantages in future networks. While technologies such as Network Functions Virtualization
    (NFV), Self-Organizing Networks (SON), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Autonomic
    Network Infrastructure (AFI) may not each exhibit all the characteristics they
    do have one thing in common: they are all dynamic rather than static, reacting
    to dynamic traffic conditions, applications, service demands as well as to changes
    in the eco-system environment.\r\nThis work item will develop a methodology (guide)
    that will extend current experience and testing approaches\r\n\r\n"
