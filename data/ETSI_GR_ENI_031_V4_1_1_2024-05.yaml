  content: "The purpose of this work item is to describe use cases and a construction
    method of fault maintenance knowledge graphs. \r\nThis GR also defines the data
    requirements, defines a schema design and describes the knowledge application
    interface fault maintenance knowledge graphs. \r\nIn addition to the main target
    related to the construction of fault maintenance network knowledge graphs, obtaining
    of computer-readable and writable network fault maintenance domain knowledge,
    and enabling of the learning and reasoning of relevant algorithm models of fault
    self-repair are also envisaged.\r\nThis GR will encompass research and investigation
    activities that will address wireless networks at the first stage. Subsequent
    efforts may extend the work into access networks.\r\n"
