  content: "Headends in integrated broadband cable and television networks are facilities
    that acquire video service signals and then distribute those signals over an RF
    cable system. In many cases, the cable headend will use an antenna with a high
    gain mounted high on a tower to receive a TV stations broadcast signals well beyond
    the stations service area. \r\nThis TS will define system characteristics of the
    receiving equipment used in cable headends including but not limited to receiver
    noise figure, antenna gain, feeder losses, signal-to-noise ratio etc.\r\nThe work
    will be carried out in close collaboration with external organizations active
    in defining parameters of RF cable systems according to established ETSI procedures.
    It is particularly intended to support the ongoing analysis of coexistence of
    Cognitive Radio Systems in TV White Spaces and RF cable systems carried out within
    CEPT/ECC WG SE.\r\n"
