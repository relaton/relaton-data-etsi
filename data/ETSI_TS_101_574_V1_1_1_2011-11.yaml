abstract:
- content: "Headends in integrated broadband cable and television networks are facilities
    that acquire video service signals and then distribute those signals over an RF
    cable system. In many cases, the cable headend will use an antenna with a high
    gain mounted high on a tower to receive a TV station’s broadcast signals well
    beyond the station’s service area. \r\nThis TS will define system characteristics
    of the receiving equipment used in cable headends including but not limited to
    receiver noise figure, antenna gain, feeder losses, signal-to-noise ratio etc.\r\nThe
    work will be carried out in close collaboration with external organizations active
    in defining parameters of RF cable systems according to established ETSI procedures.
    It is particularly intended to support the ongoing analysis of coexistence of
    Cognitive Radio Systems in ‘TV White Spaces’ and RF cable systems carried out
    within CEPT/ECC WG SE.\r\n"
