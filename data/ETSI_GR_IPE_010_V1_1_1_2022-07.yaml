  content: "Scope of work to be undertaken: This Work Item will produce a document
    to describe a framework for use within ETSI IPE ISG to coordinate and promote
    public demonstrations of Proof of Concept (PoC) validating the key technical components
    developed in IPE. The objective of the PoCs is to build commercial awareness and
    confidence and encourage development of an open ecosystem by integrating components
    from different players.\r\nThis framework outlines:  rationale for IPE ISG PoCs;
    \ IPE ISG PoC process (submission and format of PoC Proposals, review and acceptance
    criteria of PoC proposals, and IPE ISG PoC Report format and requirements);  ETSI
    support for PoC teams."
