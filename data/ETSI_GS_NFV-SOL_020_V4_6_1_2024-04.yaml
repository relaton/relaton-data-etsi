  content: "This revision of NFV-SOL 020 provides bug fixes and other improvements
    as a Release 4 maintenance version of the document, starting with NFVSOL(23)000393.
    The scope of the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nThe work item
    will specify the service interfaces to fulfill the functional requirement of the
    container infrastructure service cluster management (CIS Cluster Management, or
    CCM in abbreviation) as specified by ETSI GS NFV-IFA 036. It will analyze the
    NFV object model for CIS cluster management and the managed objects of the referenced
    open-source solutions (e.g. Kubernetes cluster API) and provide a mapping between
    them. Based on the analysis results, the referenced solutions will be profiled
    for specifying the CIS cluster lifecycle, configuration, performance, fault and
    security management service interfaces. The resulting deliverable will contain
    normative provisions."
