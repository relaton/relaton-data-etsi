  content: "The present document contains the Mechanical, Physical and Operational
    Test Suite (MPOTS) for networking equipment relying on Plastic Optical Fiber digital
    communications for both FAST (IEEE 802.3u, 100Mbit/s) and GIGABIT (IEEE 802.3bv,
    1000Mbit/s) Ethernet data transfers along the systems interoperability specifications
    described in ETSI TS 105 175-1 [1], TS 105 175-1-1 [2] and TS 105 175-1-2 [3].\r\nThis
    report forms the guidelines to lead the technical organisation of the POF Plugtest
    event, in Bordeaux, France from 29th May to 2nd June 2017. This document is intended
    to be upgraded for future interoperability events\r\n"
