abstract:
- content: This Report contains practical implementations of the measurement methods
    as defined in EG 201 769-1 in order to establish the QoS parameters listed in
    the EG. The intention of the Report is to highlight critical aspects of the parameters,
    to provide additional information for use under practical measurement conditions
    and to provide guidance on how to achieve a balanced approach taking into account
    the ONP principles. The Report takes especially into account the differences of
    direct and indirect services.
