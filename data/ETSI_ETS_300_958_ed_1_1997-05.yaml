abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) gives the stage 3 descr\r\niption
    of the call transfer supplementary services.\r\nThis ETS specifies the procedures
    used at the radio interface (Referen\r\nce point Um as defined in GSM 04.02) for
    normal operation, registratio\r\nn, erasure, activation, deactivation, invocation
    and interrogation of\r\ncall transfer supplementary services. Provision and withdrawal
    of supp\r\nlementary services is an administrative matter between the mobile subs\r\ncriber
    and the service provider and cause no signalling on the radio i\r\nnterface.\r\nIn
    GSM 04.10 the general aspects of the specification of supplementary\r\nservices
    at the layer 3 radio interface are given.\r\nGSM 04.80 specifies the formats and
    coding for the supplementary servi\r\nces.\r\nDefinitions and descriptions of
    supplementary services are given in GS\r\nM 02.04, GSM 02.8x and GSM 02.9x-series.
    GSM 02.91 is related specific\r\nally to call transfer supplementary services.\r\nThe
    technical realization of supplementary services is described in GS\r\nM 03.11,
    GSM 03.8x and 03.9x-series. GSM 03.91 is related specifically\r\nto call transfer
    supplementary services.\r\nThe procedures for Call Control, Mobility Management
    and Radio Resourc\r\ne management at the layer 3 radio interface are defined in
    GSM 04.07 a\r\nnd GSM 04.08.\r\nThe following supplementary services belong to
    the call transfer suppl\r\nementary services and are described in this ETS\r\n-\tExplicit
    Call Transfer\t(ECT) (see clause 4).\r\n  "
