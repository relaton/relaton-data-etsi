abstract:
- content: "To present response curves from various artificial mouths. In order to
    have precise information on existing devices, measurement has been conducted in
    different laboratories. \r\nThese results represent a kind of status on the possibilities
    of using the HATS (Head And Torso Simulator) beyond 10 kHz, in particular for
    Super WideBand terminal characterization."
