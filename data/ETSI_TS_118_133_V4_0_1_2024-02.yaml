  content: "This document is the specification describing interworking methodologies
    that are defined by oneM2M for the purpose of representing interactions  with
    devices or functions in Proximal IoT networks that are not aware of oneM2M. This
    includes exposing non-oneM2M devices, applications and services to oneM2M entities
    via the oneM2M resource architecture, as well as exposing oneM2M functions and
    services to Proximal IoT networks that are not aware of oneM2M. This present document
    is independent of any specific Proximal IoT technology. Details for interworking
    with specific Proximal IoT Technologies are contained in other Technical Specifications.\r\n"
