abstract:
- content: "The goal of this work item is the study and systematisation of existing
    security proofs, including the very recent state of the art and the presentation
    of such work in an accessible monograph. The monograph shall serve as a reference
    textbook for assessing the capabilities of different QKD systems and constructing
    respective requirements and\r\nevaluation criteria for practical security evaluation
    of QKD Systems. This task will require some amount of original research of scientists
    who are not members of the QISG."
