abstract:
- content: "This Technical Specification specifies the procedures used at the CTS
    system interface with the supervision part i.e. the interface between the CTS-FP
    and the CTS-SN.\r\nOnly CTS regular supervising procedures are described; FMC
    management is not intended to be standardised. \r\nThis document does not specify
    the transmission layer but only the layer 3. \r\nWhen the notations for \"further
    study\" or \"FS\" or \"FFS\" are present in this ETS they mean that the indicated
    text is not a normative portion of this standard.\r\nThe structured functions
    and procedures of this protocol and the relationship with other layers and entities
    are described in general terms in GSMÂ 04.07.\r\n"
