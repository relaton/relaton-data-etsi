  content: "To produce an European Norm that will specify  formats for Associated
    Signature Containers (ASiC). These are containers that bind together a collection
    of signed data objects with Advanced Electronic signatures (XAdES or CAdES) applied
    to them, or with time-stamps computed on them. It will extended containers.    \r\n\r\nASiC
    core specification part will evolve the latest version of ETSI TS 102 918; ASiC
    Baseline Profile part will evolve the latest version of ETSI TS 103 174.  The
    work will include the identification and agreement of relevant issues to deal
    with during the evolution of the aforementioned TSs to EN parts. It will also
    include the specification of a new profle of ASiC for e-Invoicing\r\nPart 2 specifies
    a profile identifying a common set of options that are appropriate for maximizing
    interoperability between ASiC containers."
