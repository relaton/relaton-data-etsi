abstract:
- content: The SRdoc will describe the spectrum implications to support the necessary
    performance requirements for Narrow band Point-to-Multipoint (nP2M) system. The
    required technical information (including expected sharing and compatibility issues),
    market data and spectrum regulation (including a radio spectrum request and justification
    of it) will be described and discussed in the SRdoc. It will also be a basis for
    further development of a relevant standard for nP2M services.
