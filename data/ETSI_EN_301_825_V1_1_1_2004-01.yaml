abstract:
- content: "SS-WTLR is a supplementary service which enables a WTM user to register
    at, or de-register from, the current location within the PISN. The ability to
    register at different locations in the PISN at different times enables the WPM
    user to maintain the provided services (including the ability to make and receive
    calls) at different access points. Deregistration is used to inform the PISN that
    the WPM user is temporarily unable to make use of the provided services (including
    the receipt of incoming calls).\r\nANF-WTINFO is an  additional network feature
    which enables transfer of restriction information between Home PINX and Visitor
    PINX. ANF-WTINFO also enables the Visitor PINX or Home PINX to initiate a check
    of the current location information.\r\n"
