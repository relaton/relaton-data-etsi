  content: The purpose of this Work Item is to work on a GR about IFIT deployment
    use cases and application scenarios. As described in the GR ENI 012, IFIT is a
    key technology for ensuring the SLA of future network services and for implementing
    automated and intelligent IP networks. Several technical specifications in IETF
    have already been defined to set the basis and ISG ENI is playing an important
    role in defining the whole framework. This work includes a report of IFIT use
    cases and how they fit the ENI architecture.
