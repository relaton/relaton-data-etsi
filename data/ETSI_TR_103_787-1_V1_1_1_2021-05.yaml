  content: "This TR provides SMEs with the main concepts of cybersecurity and introduces
    a five-step process for establishing cybersecurity using standards and frameworks.
    The TR will provide guidance in language that is easy for SMEs to understand.
    \r\nThe TR addresses and provides guidance for different types of SMEs according
    to their roles in the digital ecosystem. Five widely used standards and frameworks
    that can be used to reduce the cybersecurity risks are introduced. A comparative
    analysis of these standards and frameworks is performed resulting in 17 unified
    cybersecurity control categories that serve as a quick reference for SMEs. The
    five-step process is illustrated by an exemplar SME to facilitate the implementation
    of the process. This TR can be used by SMEs as a where-to-start guideline for
    cybersecurity concepts, processes, standards and frameworks to initiate their
    own implementation. \r\nThe TR covered by this WID is the first part of a multi-part
    document. \r\nFuture parts will consider more detailed guidance on specific aspect
    of Cyber Security and aspects that may be applicable to specific sectors of SMEs,
    as part of separate future work items. Work on such future parts is expected to
    liaise with and seek input from other sector specific groups across ETSI."
