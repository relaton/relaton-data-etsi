  content: "The Technical Report identifies key mobility issues for access to IP-based
    enterprise information and communications services. It defines a taxonomy of mobility
    terms and then explores use cases and connectivity scenarios involving mobile
    enterprise users. From these it derives requirements for mobility management,
    architecture and security.\r\nMobility for enterprise communication is about making
    desktop communication and information resources available at different locations
    and while on the move. The report encompasses both wired and wireless connectivity
    using enterprise and public all-IP-networks for voice, data and converged services.
    \r\nThis Technical Report is intended as an aid to analysing gaps in standardization
    that prevent or hinder mobility in enterprise communications and information access.
    \r\n"
