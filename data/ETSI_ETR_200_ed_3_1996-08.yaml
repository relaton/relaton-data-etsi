  content: "This ETSI Technical Report (ETR) clarifies recommended measures which\r\nmay
    be adopted by the GSM infrastructure to enable interworking to be\r\nobtained
    between the GSM infrastructure and various Mobile Station (MS\r\nimplementations
    of the GSM Phase 1 standard. The objective is to obtai\r\ncompatibility without
    changing the consolidated set of Phase 1\r\nspecifications. This ETR describes
    the recommended changes to the\r\ninfrastructure to cater for specific faults
    within some Phase 1 MSs.\r\nThe lifetime of the herein described measures together
    with their\r\npotential impact on optimal network performance is out of the scope
    of\r\nthis ETR\r\n  "
