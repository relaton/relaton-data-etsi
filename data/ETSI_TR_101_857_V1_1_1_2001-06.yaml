    the public network operators and public service providers in producing publications
    that describe their public interfaces in  accordance with article 4.2 of Directive
    1999/5/EC.\r\nThis document will describe the network presentation points and
    list the characteristics of a CATV network interface(s) used to provide telecommunications
    services which could be necessary for a description of that interface. This document
    does not give guidance on the style of presentation format of interface publications."
