abstract:
- content: "This Technical Report introduces evolution of Energy Storage applicable
    for use with stationary ICT/Telecom equipment and global results of investigations
    in laboratories or from field tests in Telecom/ICT network or customer premises
    e.g. for resilience in smart sustainable city. Mobile and portable batteries are
    out of the scope. This part 0 introduces next subparts such as part 1 on innovative
    batteries, part 2 on supercapacitors.\r\nThese WIs were also submitted to ITU-T
    SG5/WP3 for a joint activity; ITU-T WI (L.ENST 1,2,3)"
