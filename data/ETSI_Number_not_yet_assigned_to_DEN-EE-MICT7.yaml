abstract:
- content: "The objective of this standard is to provide methods to measure and calculate
    the standardised physical dimensions of rechargeable batteries of cordless phones
    in support of Regulation (EU) 2023/1670 and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1669.\r\nThe
    consistency with the following standards will be ensured: \r\n(a) EN 61960-3:2017,
    section 5, in the case of cordless phones equipped with lithium batteries; \r\n(b)
    EN IEC 60086-2, in the other cases. \r\n\r\nThe standard will describe at least
    the apparatus to be used, the necessary steps and conditions for the measurement
    and calculation of the standardised physical dimensions of rechargeable batteries
    of cordless phones, and the information to be given in the test report for each
    tested unit.\r\n"
