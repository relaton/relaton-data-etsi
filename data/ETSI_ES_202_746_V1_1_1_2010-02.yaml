  content: "This STF will standardize a rule definition language for defining automatic
    activation of profiles, a set of components (including attributes, operations
    and relations) and a common terminology related to user profile management. The
    work will build on results from STF265 on User Profile Management. With the goal
    of obtaining maximum benefits for users, profiles would not be limited to cover
    today's ICT market, but would also embrace ubiquitous services and applications,
    and be able to communicate with a wide range of devices in digital homes/buildings.
    \r\nThe deliverable will be an ETSI Standard that will standardize:\r\n- objects
    (including settings, values, operations and relations) related to user profile
    management;\r\n- rule definition language for defining automatic activation of
    profiles;\r\n- common terminology."
