  content: 'To generate:  1)  The specification of mechanisms for incorporating Evicence
    Record Syntax (RFC 4998 and RFC 6283) into a XAdES signature as an alternative
    Proof Of Existance to xadesv141:ArchiveTimeStmap.  2) The specification of how
    the new mechanisms should be managed for being incorporated into XAdES signatures
    with xadesv141:ArchiveTimeStamp already incorporated.  3) The specification of
    how the new mechanisms should be managed for being incorporated to legacy XAdES
    signatures.   Also to include  the new aforementioned mechanisms into the repertoire
    of XAdES levels signatures already defined (this can imply the definition of a
    new level)'
