  content: "The purpose of the ammendment to this I-ETS is to correct the technical
    and editorial errors raised as a result of V 109. Where the existing\r\nscope
    shall not be altered from:\r\n\"This I-ETS specifies those electro-acoustical
    characteristics that a handset telephony terminal should fulfill to ensure the
    minimum speech\r\nqaulity when communicating accross the European Public Switched
    telephone Networks (PSTNs).\r\n The objective of this I-ETS is to ensure interworking
    between Terminal Equipment (TE) via the public network.\r\nThis I-ETS applies
    in conjunction with the general requirements for PSTN access contained in ETS
    300 001 [1]. The requirements of this I-ETS\r\nare additional to those for connection
    to the two-wire interface of the PSTN specified in ETS 300 001 [1].\r\nThe requirements
    of this I-ETS provide real-time (live) two-way speech of a quality consistent
    with the ITU-T (CCITT) P-series of \r\nRecommendations.\r\nThe testing specification
    for analogue handset telephony is specified in I-ETS 300 480 [2].\r\nThis I-ETS
    is applicable both to handset telephony terminals and the handset telephony function
    of a multi-function terminal.\r\nThe following functions are outside the scope
    of this I-ETS:\r\n-hands free or loudspeaking function;\r\n-cordless telephony;\r\n-telephony
    for people with audio-related impairments (e.g. telephones\r\nwith additional
    receive amplification as an aid for the hard of hearing);\r\n -telephony terminals
    designed for use in hostile environments;\r\n-key systems or Private Automatic
    Branch eXchange (PABX) system dependent terminals;\r\n-telephones using non-linear
    or time variant signal processing techniques.\r\n"
