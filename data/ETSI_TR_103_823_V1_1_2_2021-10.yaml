  content: "This technical report will provide a snapshot of the technical descriptions
    of the Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) selected by NIST for the third round
    of their post-quantum standardisation process.\r\n\r\nBecause specifications and
    performance figures are likely to change, the scope of the report will be limited
    to presenting just the mathematical descriptions of the selected KEMs, as specified
    at the beginning of the third round of the standardisation process.\r\n\r\nBy
    collating and presenting the technical descriptions using consistent, well-defined
    notation and terminology, ETSI QSC will provide the cryptography community with
    a valuable reference document that will aid in the analysis of the KEMs most likely
    to be selected for future standardisation.\r\n\r\nThis work is complementary to
    TR 103 616, which will present a similar snapshot of the technical details of
    the signature algorithms selected by NIST for the third round of their post-quantum
    standardisation process."
