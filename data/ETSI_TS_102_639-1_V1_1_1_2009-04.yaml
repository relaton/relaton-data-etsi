abstract:
- content: "This ETSI Standard is part of a series that define the third generation
    of radio-frequency interface specifications for high-speed data-over-cable systems
    in Europe. This document may be based on, but not limited to, ITU-T SG9 J.222
    Recommendation. The scope of this work item will include definition of PHY (physical),
    Security services and MAC and Upper Layer Protocol Interfaces for a third generation
    transmission system for IP cable modems. This third generation provides for advanced
    features including the ability to bond multiple channels together and support
    for IP version 6, while maintaining backwards compatibility with the first generation
    [ES 201 488] and second generation [ES 202 488].\r\nThis particular part provides
    an overview of the set of documents and describes the general scope of the work."
