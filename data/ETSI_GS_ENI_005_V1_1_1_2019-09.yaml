abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this work item is to draft a GS to define the software
    functional architecture of ENI. This includes:\r\n   - defining the software functions
    and interactions that satisfy the ENI Requirements\r\n   - defining a software
    architecture, in terms of functional blocks, that can meet the needs specified
    by the ENI Use Cases\r\n   - functional blocks will define the structure and behavior
    of a particular view of a system\r\n   - functional blocks will define a set of
    system components that work collaboratively to implement the functionality of
    the system\r\n   - defining Integration Reference Points that the above functional
    blocks use for all communication with systems and entities that are external to
    the ENI System.\r\n"
