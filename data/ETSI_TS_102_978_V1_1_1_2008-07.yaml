  content: The present document specifies the transport of IPDC services using the
    MSC stream mode of DAB (EN 300 401 [10]) including additional error protection
    (TS 102 427 [11]). The present document specifies the mechanism for the multiplexing
    of multimedia services using MPEG-2 TS[14]. For efficiency, some appropriate restrictions
    to MPEG-2 TS and an efficient transmission method for PSI/SI and SAT sections
    are specified. The present document also specifies methods of macro and micro
    time slicing for power-efficient transmission of IPDC Services in DAB systems.
    Therefore audio and video can be transmitted at variable bit-rates. The methods
    for sub-channel synchronization and data arrangement are specified.
