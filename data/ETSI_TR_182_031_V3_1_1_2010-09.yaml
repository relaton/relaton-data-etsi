abstract:
- content: This feasibility study covers a use case analysis for the interaction of
    RACS with the CPN, as well as an analysis of required functional entities, reference
    points and information flows. Furthermore, requirements for interworking with
    in-home QoS control mechanisms are studied. The work item concludes with a recommendation
    on the way, or ways, how RACS and CPN should interact and interface, i.e., on
    one or several interworking architecture(s) proposal(s).
