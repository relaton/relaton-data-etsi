  content: "The study item will study use cases, key issues and recommendations related
    to exposing abstracted cellular network information for the vertical industries.\r\nDifferent
    industry segments have different needs for the abstracted information and a few
    different industry areas e.g. AR&VR, V2X, Logistics, Future Factories, Coordinated
    Robots and Drones will be used to study the use cases and related key issues.
    The aim for the abstraction is to provide a developer-friendly API that hides
    the complexity and does not require deep understanding of the underlying cellular
    network. The work considers the learnings from the MEC PoC, Plugtests, MEC Sandbox
    and Edge discovery days / MEC panels as well as feedback from the appropriate
    industry organizations such as 5GAA and 5G-ACIA and open source projects. The
    outcome of the study is to generate recommendations for the future MEC standard
    work in exposing abstracted network information for the vertical industries."
