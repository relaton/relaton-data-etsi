  content: "The NWI will study the role of traceability in the challenge of Securing
    AI and explore issues related to sharing and re-using models across tasks and
    industries. The scope includes threats, and their associated remediations where
    applicable, to ownership rights of AI creators as well as to verification of models
    origin, integrity or purpose. Mitigations can be non-AI-Specific (Digital Right
    Management applicable to AI) and AI-specific techniques (e.g. watermarking) from
    prevention and detection phases. They can be both model-agnostic or model enhancement
    techniques. Threats and mitigations specific to the collaborative learning setting,
    implying multiple data and model owners, could be also explored.\r\n\r\nThe NWI
    will align terminology with existing ETSI ISG SAI documents and studies, and reference/complement
    previously studied attacks and remediations (ETSI GR SAI 004, ETSI GR SAI 005).
    It will also gather industrial and academic feedback on traceability and ownership
    rights protection and model verification (including integrity of model metadata)
    in the context of AI."
