abstract:
- content: "Specifies Interface(s) between the ITS security entity and the ITS facilities
    layer including interface services and service primitives which are extensible
    in order to achieve general applicability. Specifies related procedures and common
    parameters. \r\nSecurity services to be specified in this TS include at least:
    \r\n(1)\tEncrypting and decrypting single message\r\n(2)\tAuthorizing and validating
    authorization on single message\r\n(3)\tLogging security events\r\n(4)\tEncapsulating
    outbound messages and decapasulating inbound messages using security profiles.
    Note: This is an alternative way of implementing encryption/decryption and/or
    authorizing/authorization-validation services.\r\nDevelopment is with consultation
    of TC ITS WG1.\r\n"
