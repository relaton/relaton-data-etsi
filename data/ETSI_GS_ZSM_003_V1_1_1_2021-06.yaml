abstract:
- content: "Investigate the available standards and open source outputs relevant to
    support the requirements and solutions for the zero-touch, inclusive of 100% automation,
    management and orchestration of end to end network slicing. \r\nTaking into account
    identified gaps, specify the end to end zero-touch management solutions and management
    interfaces to support the recognized use cases and requirements in alignment with
    the agreed zero touch end-to-end network and service management architecture.
    The available standards and open source outputs will be used and referred where
    appropriate in the end to end zero-touch management solution."
