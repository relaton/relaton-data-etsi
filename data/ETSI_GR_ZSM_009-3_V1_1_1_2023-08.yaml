abstract:
- content: This study investigates advanced topics related to closed-loop operations
    such as learning and cognitive capabilities (e.g. based on different degrees of
    use and integration of artificial intelligence technologies), ways to set and
    evaluate levels of oversight, autonomy, and operational confidence on the behaviour
    of the closed loops.  The study will document problem statements and technical
    challenges, derive potential requirements, capture and evaluate potential solution
    options, and provide recommendations for further standardization activities.
