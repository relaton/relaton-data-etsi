abstract:
- content: "The present document proposes leveraging and improving the existing ITU-T
    Recommendations P1201 (P1201.1, P1201.2) and G1072, and ETSI TR 103 702 to provide
    QoS parameters for users who experience Cloud Gaming Services over RTP/UDP streaming.
    In particular, the present document proposes to extend the G1072 model, which
    predicts the expected QoS/MOS for given network conditions, to the single user
    analysis allowed by non-intrusive passive monitoring and provided by feeding such
    model with measured or estimated end-user packet loss, round-trip time, video
    bitrate, framerate, and information derived from the game platform capabilities
    and streaming data. Moreover, in addition to H.264 characterization provided by
    G1072, the present document proposes to address H.265 and VP9 video codecs and
    audio chat.\r\n\r\nThe identified QoS parameters will refer to the following categories
    with the aim also to address an effective Root Cause Analysis:\r\n-Service Centric
    (Subscriber IP address, Cloud gaming Platform Name, …)\r\n\r\n-Cloud Gaming Session
    (Platform Start Time, Game Start Time, Streaming Start Time, Play Start Time,
    Streaming End Time, Streaming Duration, …)\r\n\r\n-Media (MOS, Audio/Video Bitrate,
    Video Framerate, Audio/Video Packets, Audio/Video Downlink/Uplink bytes, ….)\r\n\r\n-Transport
    (Network Round Trip Time, Packet Loss Rate, Packet retransmission, Server addresses,
    Server ports, SSRC, …)\r\n"
