  content: 'This document defines an interoperability framework for pandemic contact
    tracing systems which allows the centralized and decentralized modes of operation
    to fully interoperate. This document is part of the family of ISG E4P GS/GRs  and
    thus aligned with GS Requirements for Pandemic Contact Tracing Systems using Mobile
    Devices. It covers interoperability between ROBERT, NHSX, DP3T, DESIRE, ProntoC2
    and other applications/protocols as well as the different device platforms, some
    of which may emerge also during ISG E4P work.  '
