abstract:
- content: Instantiation of the Reference Model for Autonomic Networking, Cognition
    and Self-Management onto the IMS architecture (ETSI TS 123 228) by superimposing
    GANA Decision Elements (DEs) into node/device architectures and the overall network
    architecture, so that the DEs and their associated Control-Loops can be further
    designed to perform autonomic management and control of the specific resources
    (Managed Entities) in the target architecture. The behaviours of the GANA Functional
    Blocks (FBs) will be specified.
