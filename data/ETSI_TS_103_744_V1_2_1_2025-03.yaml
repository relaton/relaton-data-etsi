  content: This work item is intended to define additional methods and architectures
    for combining a quantum-safe key encapsulation method with a classical key exchange
    methods to ensure the resulting negotiated keys are as secure as the strongest
    of the individual schemes being combined.  The proposal covers how the exchanged
    elements of the methods and the associated shared secrets are combined using a
    pseudo-random function or key derivation function to define cryptographic key
    material suitable for storage or session security.
