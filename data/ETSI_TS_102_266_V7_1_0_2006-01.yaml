abstract:
- content: "The UICC may contain several applications, each dealing with keys and
    realising crypto services. Some keys might be shareable (e.g. signing key of the
    WIM application) but there are no standardised mechanisms to share keys and indicate
    allowed functions to authorised applications. \r\nTo allow applications on the
    UICC to use shared security objects, it's essential that there is one standardised
    mechanism to administer and use these shared objects on the UICC. \r\nThe USSM
    (UICC Security Services Module) will consist of  \r\n- security objects (keys,
    pins, ... ) including information on allowed functions and authorised applications
    \r\n- an API for administrative functions to administer objects of the USSM\r\n-
    an API for cryptographic functions (non administrative) to be used by applications\r\n\r\nThe
    scope of this Work Item is:\r\n- Preparation of a stage 1 service requirements
    document including the needed functions \r\n- Initial work on the format of parameters
    used in the functions \r\n(existing specifications (e.g. ISO 7816-15, Global Platform,
    ...) are taken into account for evaluation if mechanisms of them can be reused.\r\n"
