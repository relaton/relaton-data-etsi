abstract:
- content: "This document describes the architectural framework for the delivery of
    DVB-services over IP-based networks. It is the baseline document introducing the
    reference model and basic service class descriptions.\r\nTaking into account that
    DVB will specify only the necessary interfaces, leaving implementation of the
    system and system components to the industry, this architectural framework aims
    to explain how various sets of interfaces work together to enable the different
    service classes.\r\nThe DVB-IP architecture is applicable to all system and service
    implementations, using Integrated Receiver Decoders, TV sets and multimedia PCs
    as well as clusters of such devices, connected to Home Networks. It is intended
    for use by implementers of both systems and services."
