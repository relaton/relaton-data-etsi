  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) is based on the\r\nprinciples
    of terminal adaptor functions presented in the CCITT\r\nI-series of recommendations
    (I.460 - I.463).\r\nThe GSM PLMN supports a wide range of voice and non-voice
    services in\r\nthe same network. In order to enable non-voice traffic in the GSM
    PLMN\r\nthere is a need to connect various kinds of terminal equipments to the\r\nMobile
    Termination (MT). The target of this Specification is to\r\noutline the functions
    needed for the terminal adaptation.\r\nIn the GSM 02.02 the bearer services are
    described. The general\r\nnetwork configuration is described in GSM 03.02 and
    the GSM PLMN\r\naccess reference configuration is defined in GSM 04.02. The various\r\nconnection
    types used in the GSM PLMN are presented in GSM 03.10.\r\nTerminology used in
    this Specification is presented in GSM 01.04. For\r\nsupport of data services
    between GSM PLMN and other networks see GSM\r\n09-series of Specifications.\r\n"
