abstract:
- content: 'Define a new additional measurement procedure for Low Duty Cycle. The
    objective is to include the results in EN 303 883. Current measurement procedure(s)
    for Low Duty Cycle as defined in TS 102 883 V1.1.1. are not sufficient with respect
    to short Toff time periods between pulse bursts. Target of this work item is to
    define an additional procedure, that is applicable to all kind of signals and
    yields accurate results.The current understanding is that such a method is only
    possible to be done in the time domain with Oscilloscopes. Investigation of time
    domain parameters and necessary equipment has to be done '
