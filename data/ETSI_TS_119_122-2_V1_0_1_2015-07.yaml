  content: "The present document specifies CAdES digital signatures. CAdES signatures
    are built on CMS signatures, by incorporation of signed and unsigned attributes,
    which fulfil certain common requirements (such as the long term validity of digital
    signatures, for instance) in a number of use cases.\r\nThe present document specifies
    a number of CAdES signature levels, each one based on different combinations of
    attributes, with a higher degree of optionality than the CAdES baseline signatures
    specified in part 1.\r\nCAdES digital signatures aim at supporting electronic
    signatures in different regulatory frameworks.\r\n"
