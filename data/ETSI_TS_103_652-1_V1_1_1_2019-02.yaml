  content: "This new work item focusses on developing a Technical Specification (TS)
    covering the specific system requirements for providing spectrum access for local
    high-quality wireless networks, as introduced in TR 103 588.\r\n\r\nThe work is
    based on the generic aspects of the current ETSI specifications for Licensed Shared
    Access in the 2.3-2.4 GHz band and on the functional enhancements proposed in
    TR 103 588, but will be agnostic to radio frequency bands.\r\n\r\nThe requirements
    are intended as a first step towards the definition of an evolved LSA system architecture
    specification for providing spectrum access for local high-quality wireless networks.\r\n"
