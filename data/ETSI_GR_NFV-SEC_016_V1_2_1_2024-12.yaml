abstract:
- content: The present document is a study on how the location of sensitive VNFs (e.g.
    VNFs handling data with Data Protection location handling restrictions, network
    security functions and LI functions) can be attested. The present document considers
    the use of trusted locstamp and timestamp information derived from Global Navigation
    Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as Galileo. The present document also considers
    other physical location binding solutions. The capabilities described also have
    benefits for other less sensitive virtualised services which may need to verify
    location of VNFs or data. The proposed work item for revision is to update SEC016
    on the term TPM with generic descriptions, including using NFV-SECâ€™s own term
    HBRT, or adding equivalent hardware implementations, just like IETF draft-ietf-rats-tpm-based-network-device-attest-14
    says in the abstract.
