  content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 003 conducts NFV Release 2 maintenance: it corrects
    errors, ambiguities, misalignments, and applies editorial modifications (i.e.
    Corrections of category F and D as described in ETSI TWPs Annex L). This edition
    does not add or modify features, nor does it extend the scope of the former Release
    2 edition summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nIFA 003 specifies performance benchmarking
    metrics for virtual switching, with the goal that the metrics will adequately
    quantify performance gains achieved through virtual switch acceleration conforming
    to the associated requirements specified herein. The acceleration-related requirements
    will be applicable to common virtual switching functions across usage models such
    as packet delivery into VNFs, network overlay and tunnel termination, stateful
    Network Address Translators (NAT), service chaining, load balancing and, in general,
    match-action based policies/flows applied to traffic going to/from the VMs. IFA
    003 also provides deployment scenarios with applicability to multiple vendor implementations
    and recommendations for follow-on proof of concept activities."
