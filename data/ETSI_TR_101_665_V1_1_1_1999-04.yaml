abstract:
- content: "The work item has to:\r\n- determine a set of ETSI CS3 capabilities\r\n-
    determine if new SIBs/service constituents need to be developed to\r\nprovide
    these capabilities\r\n- contribute to the results of ITU-T\r\n The modelling method
    of IN CS3 capabilities might be subject to change\r\nalong the lines of technological
    evolution as identified in other\r\nbodies and working groups. Hence, this work
    item will study whether GF\r\nand Service Plane need to be enhanced so that they
    can cope with the\r\nrequirements for ITU-T CS3, IN-B-ISDN (WG3) and mobility
    service\r\ncapabilities\r\n"
