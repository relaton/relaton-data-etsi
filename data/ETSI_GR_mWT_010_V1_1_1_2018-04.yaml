abstract:
- content: "To conduct detailed interference analysis by using 3D Ray-Tracing tools
    that can take into account the geometry of high dense urban environments, considering:\r\nProper
    V-Band Channel Model  in real environment\r\nUrban canyoning and dense urban scenarios
    using GIS database (by selecting real cities scenes).\r\nTo consider wide bandwidth
    systems (WiGig like) as potential interferers\r\nTo produce a number of useful
    results like:\r\nRSL maps\r\nSNR maps\r\nLoS probability\r\nMulti-paths impact\r\nVegetation
    penetration loss\r\nDe-polarization effects\r\n…others…\r\nTo define useful performance
    (i.e. availability and throughput) and installation KPI’s for link/network deployments\r\nOutcomes
    of this analysis are intended to be liaised to ITU-R WP 3, ECC/SE19, and to other
    relevant groups identified in due course,  as contribution for disc\r\n"
