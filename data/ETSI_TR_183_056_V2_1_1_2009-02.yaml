abstract:
- content: This TR will investigate new methods for providing overlap sending originating
    from PSTN devices. The expectation is that such methods would save on processing
    that the present method for overlap sending deploys. It is also the aim of this
    investigation is to fully backward compatible, have no impact upon the SIP signalling
    protocols, and have a minimal impact upon the existing SIP nodes.
