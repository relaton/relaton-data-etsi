abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "To define an emergency warning system (EWS) for DAB which features an
    additional FIG for signalling the identity, status and location of an emergency
    with the ability for suitably equipped receivers to wake from a low-power sleep
    mode to provide an audio alert message targeted to the specific geographical area
    of concern.\r\nThe rules of implementation ensure that a reliable and consistent
    experience will be delivered for digital radio listeners; they provide implementation
    details for how the Fast Information Channel (FIC) signalling is used and how
    receivers will interpret and behave in response to receiving the FIC signalling.
    \r\n\r\n"
