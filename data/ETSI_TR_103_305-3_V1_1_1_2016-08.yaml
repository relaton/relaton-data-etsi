abstract:
- content: The present document is intended as an evolving repository for guidelines
    on service sector Critical Security Control implementations.  Because of their
    rapidly scaling importance and need for defensive measures, the mobile device
    and Internet of Things (IoT) sectors are treated.  The CSC are a specific set
    of technical measures available to detect, prevent, respond, and mitigate damage
    from the most common to the most advanced of cyber attacks.
