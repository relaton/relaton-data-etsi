    earth stations in order to ensure general safety & to limit\r\ninterference to
    other radio communication services.\r\nThe term \"2 GHz\" in the title covers
    four bands: 1980-2010 MHz (up),\r\n2170-2200 MHz (down), 2500-2520 MHz (down)
    and 2670-2690 MHz (up)\r\nunder the MSS. System considerations are included.\r\n(11/03/97
    az) This standard together with ETS 300 831 is intended to\r\nbecome a harmonised
