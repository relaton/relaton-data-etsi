  content: "This TS is to specify profiles for Attribute Attestations. More specifically
    this WI shall specify:\r\n\r\n Semantics for the components of attribute attestations.
    This will include, among others, information as listed in Annex V of eIDAS 2.0.\r\n\r\n
    Binding of semantics to profiling one or more syntaxes including those required
    by the EUDI Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework.\r\n\r\nThe standard will
    not limit the types of attributes carried in an Attribute Assertion.  The standard
    will support selective disclosure of attributes.  This will take into account
    the study on selective disclosure in TR 119 476."
