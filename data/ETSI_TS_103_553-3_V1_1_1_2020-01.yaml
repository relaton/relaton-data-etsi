  content: "This series introduces evolution of Energy Storage applicable for use
    with stationary ICT/Telecom equipment and global results of investigations in
    laboratories or from field tests in Telecom/ICT network or customer premises e.g.
    for resilience in smart sustainable city. Mobile and portable batteries are out
    of the scope. \r\n\r\nThe scope of this document includes: - identification of
    available Supercapacitor technology or roadmap - Characteristics (electrical ,
    mechanical, thermal, ) - Test lab results and/or field experiment results - Recommendations
    of adapted use of each technology - Recommendation for appropriate minimum benchmark
    tests and deeper characterization  \r\n\r\nThese WIs are also present in ITU-T
    SG5/WP3 for a joint activity; ITU-T WI (L.ENST 1,2,3)"
