  content: This work item will prepare a new Standards Landscape based on ETSI ISG
    ARFs functional reference model (i.e., ETSI GS ARF 003). Having ETSI GS AR 003
    as the foundation for the new standards landscape will ensure that the European-developed
    reference model is widely accepted. Furthermore, as a result of the breadth and
    depth of the ETSI ISG ARF functional reference model, SDOs and other stakeholders
    in the AR industry will be able to use the mew standards landscape for prioritizing
    new work or continue their standards development in confidence.
