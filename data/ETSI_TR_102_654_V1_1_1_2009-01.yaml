- content: European CEN Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) equipment operating
    in the frequency range from 5 795 MHz to 5 815 MHz can suffer from interference
    caused by Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and other users of the same and
    adjacent frequency bands. This Technical Report will provide guidance on how to
    achieve co-existence between DSRC equipment and other users.
