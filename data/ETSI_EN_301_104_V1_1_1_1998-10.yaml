  content: "The identification of the Human Factors issues in the creation of a European
    Numbering Space and the creation of recommendations for addressing those issues.
    The recommendations will be targeted at those who need to implement and test a
    European Numbering Space. Issues that have been identified during the production
    of TR101056 include: difficulties with long telephone numbers, effects related
    to number portability, the way in which European Numbers can be identified and
    how users can identify their costs, the effect of call delays, linguistic difficulties
    with European services, and the need for usability testing.\r\n"
