  content: "Children (12 years and younger) are becoming an increasingly significant
    consumer group for advanced computing and communications services.  In some cases
    children as young as two or three are using ICT (Information and Communications
    Technology) equipment.  Children are often expected to use equipment designed
    for adults that has inappropriate physical and cognitive ergonomics for their
    needs.  The difficulty of access that this causes can act as a barrier for this
    group to the benefits of computing and communications services, as well as causing
    unnecessary physical and psychological stress through poor workstation/product
    design.\r\nThis work item will review the human interaction issues for access
    to ICT by children and provide guidance on how these should be dealt with by ETSI.
    \ This will include the ethical issues of security for vulnerable children accessing
    public communications spaces. The STF will place key issues related to ICT access
    by young children within a conceptual framework that also encompasses young people
    between the ages of 12 and 18. The main emphasis will, however, be on issues and
    actions relevant for the 12 and under age group.\r\nThis STF will emphasise opportunities
    for simple generic solutions, that are commercially attractive to network operators
    and equipment providers for delivery as a sustainable revenue generating activity,
    which open information and communications technologies to consumers who might
    otherwise be excluded. \r\nThe STF will deliver a technical report that will identify
    key issues, potential solutions, and make recommendations to ETSI for the specific
    actions that need to be taken in this area. Where possible this will be supported
    by simple practical examples.\r\n\r\n"
