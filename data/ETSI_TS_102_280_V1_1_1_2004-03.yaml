  content: The normative work to be carried out has been pointed out by the voluntary
    ETSI TR 102 153. The scope of this task is to provide a set of certificate profiles,
    which will allow actual interoperability of certificates issued under the various
    European Member States' provisions for the purposes of qualified and advanced
    electronic signatures, peer entity authentication and data authentication. The
    standard needs the input of those bodies that define the certificate profiles
    and those that run the qualified certification services providers' accreditation.
    These actors are currently not represented in ETSI ESI and thus they will be invited
    to become involved in this standard's development, promotion and implementation.
    The development of this standard is to be done in close interaction with corresponding
    standardization organizations, namely IETF and ISO.
