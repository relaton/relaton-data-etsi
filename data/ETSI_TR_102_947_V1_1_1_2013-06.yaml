  content: "The scope of the work in this technical report is to identify use cases
    and provide system level functionality for building and exploiting evolutionary
    Radio Environment Maps (REMs) in a single or multi-RAT context in intra-operator
    scenarios.\r\nBuilding the REM within RRS context requires the enhancement of
    existing network entities, protocols and interfaces accomplishing the tasks of
    requesting, storing and processing geo-located measurements related to the radio
    environment.\r\nIt is expected that REMs will be exploited in a RRS context for
    network troubleshooting and radio resource management optimization. \r\nThe document
    includes a general description of the use cases and associated stakeholders as
    well as information flows and high level requirements. Technical challenges are
    also identified.\r\n"
