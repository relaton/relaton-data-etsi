  content: This work item will do the gap analysis and identify the requirements of
    3GPP mobile network towards deterministic networking capabilities for the Ultra
    Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC) applications.The target is to propose
    a holistic architecture which includes functions,interface and protocols for how
    to realize end-to-end deterministic networking across Radio Access Network, Core
    Network, Back-haul or transport, and virtual networks within data center.
