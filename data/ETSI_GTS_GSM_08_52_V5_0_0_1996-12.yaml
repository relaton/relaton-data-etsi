abstract:
- content: "The use and general aspects of the A-bis interface are given in GSM 08\r\n.51.\r\nThis
    Global System for Mobile communications Technical Specification (\r\nGTS) gives
    the principle basis for the rest of the specifications spec\r\nifying the interface
    between the Base Station Controller (BSC), and th\r\ne Base Transceiver Station
    (BTS), with its transceivers (TRX). These c\r\nomponents together form the Base
    Station System (BSS). (The interface\r\nbetween MSC and the BSS is specified in
    GSM 08.01 to 08.20.)\r\nThe intention with this interface is to get a unified
    way of connectin\r\ng remotely located BTSs/TRXs to a BSC allowing for the interconnection\r\nof
    BSCs and BTSs/TRXs from different manufacturers.\r\nIn order to keep the BTS as
    simple as possible, BTS contains only thos\r\ne functions which have to reside
    close to the radio interface.\r\n  "
