abstract:
- content: 'The WI will identify and describe use cases and scenarios that are enabled
    with enhanced experience, through the use of network intelligence. The use cases
    and scenarios will detail where the intelligence can be applied in the fixed network,
    mobile network, or both. The report will give the baseline on how the studies
    in ENI will substantially benefit the operators and other stakeholders.  '
