abstract:
- content: "A private wide area paging system which provides the flexibility,\r\nversatility
    and speed of an on-site paging system but covering\r\na wider area.\r\nMinimum
    performance characteristics and related methods of\r\nmeasurement for private
    wide-area paging systems. On-site paging\r\nsystems with an extended free field
    range achieved by using a higher\r\ntransmitter power and antenna location, as
    well as a specified\r\nreceiver sensitivity. It may use time sharing in order
    to increase the\r\nnumber of virtually available channels. The time sharing proposed
    is a\r\nfree running system that requires minimum overhead and supplies\r\nminimum
    loss of net-airtime.\r\nThe provisions for EMC compatibility are defined in the
    relevant EMC\r\nstandard.The system will work in the high band VHF or UHF frequency\r\nrange.\r\nTypes
    of equipment covered: base station transmitters/ receivers/\r\ntransceivers, pocket
    receivers.\r\nPotential customers include emergency services, hospitals and\r\nmanufacturing
    industry that may be located at various sites within\r\nthe coverage area.\r\nAdditional
    standards/specifications may be required for equipment\r\ninteded to interface
    to the PSTN.\r\n"
