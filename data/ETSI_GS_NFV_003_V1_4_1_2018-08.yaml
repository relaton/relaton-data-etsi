abstract:
- content: This document intends to provide terms and definitions for conceptual entities
    with the scope of the NFV work, in order to achieve a "common language" across
    all the NFV working groups and for wider industry discussions on this topic. It
    should be noted, that terminology, architecture and requirements very much depend
    on each other, and that this document may need to be revised to align with the
    content of various group specifications and iterations of the ISG architecture
    document.
