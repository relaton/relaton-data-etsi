  content: "As NFV transitions to phase 2, the current PoC Framework, which includes
    references to NFV phase 1 WGs, will become outdated.\r\nThe goal of this WI is
    to make an editorial revision of the NFV PoC Framework (NFV-PER002) in order to
    align it with the NFV Phase 2 WG structure, as well as to ensure the continuity
    of the PoC activity during the transition phase (NFV#8 to NFV#9)\r\n"
