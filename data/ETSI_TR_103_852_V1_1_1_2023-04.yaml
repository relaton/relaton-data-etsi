abstract:
- content: 'To describe the problems arising from inconsistency of usability and accessibility
    design practices in video game controls and to identify the role of standards-based
    solutions to inconsistent design practise. This will involve identifying and illustrating
    the challenges relating to implementing usability and accessibility measures in
    video games. The usability and accessibility measures covered will involve examining
    their impact on users with hearing, vision, touch, cognitive and motor control
    types of disabilities. Part of this will be achieved by a gap analysis of what
    is currently done to be mapped, for comparison, with an idealised model in order
    to identify what needs to be done to bridge any identified gaps. The report will
    identify use cases to describe the application of usability and accessibility
    measures and their relative impact on video games design. This report will identify
    mitigations to the identified gaps in the form of additional guidance or standardisation
    from ETSI.  '
