abstract:
- content: "The work item will specify extensions and new capabilities (so-called
    \"AI enablers\") for the ZSM framework reference architecture providing support
    for the automation of management functionalities and operations based on Artificial
    Intelligence (AI), applicable end-to-end and per management domain. The set of
    AI-enabling capabilities will be specified as management services, complementing
    the existing management services defined in ETSI GS ZSM 002 V1.1.1. The focus
    will be on AI-related areas such as data (including data handling and analytics),
    action, interoperation, governance and execution environment. Furthermore, the
    use and integration in the ZSM framework of externally provided AI-based capabilities
    will be taken into account. \r\nThe work item will consider AI-related scenarios
    defined in ETSI GS ZSM 001 V1.1.1, as well as new scenarios, in order to derive
    AI-specific requirements. The work item will also document deployment aspects
    of the above scenarios to validate the applicability of the AI enablers. Related
    work from standard development organizations, open source projects and other sources
    will be considered and re-used, where applicable, in the development of the specifications."
