abstract:
- content: "The scope of this work item is to define a refined set of scenarios and
    requirements beyond those indicated in ETSI TR 102 680. In particular, this work
    item will prepare further work within Working Group 2 on the role of the various
    building blocks of the SDR Reference Architecture for Mobile Device as defined
    in ETSI TR 102 680, including \r\n-Configuration Manager (CM) for (de)installation
    and (un)loading of radio applications into radio computer as well as management
    of and access to the radio parameters of those radio applications;\r\n-Radio Connection
    Manager (RCM) for (de)activation of radio applications according to user requests
    and overall management of user data flows, which can also be switched from one
    radio application to another;\r\n-Flow Controller (FC) for sending and receiving
    of user data packets and controlling the flow.\r\n-Multiradio Controller (MRC)
    for scheduling the requests on spectrum resources issued by concurrently executing
    radio applications in order to detect in advance the interoperability problems
    between them;\r\n-Resource Manager (RM) for management of radio computer resources
    in order to share them among simultaneously active radio applications, while guaranteeing
    their real-time requirements.\r\nAlso, various types of user entities with different
    levels of responsibility and freedom of action will be defined. These may include
    the following ones: \r\n- Administrator user, which can configure the set of available
    radio applications and manage the configurations of individual radio applications;\r\n-Mobility
    Policy Manager user, which maintains policies and preferences of the network,
    mobile device, and device end user, and makes selection of radio applications
    according to these policies, preferences, and information available; \r\nNetworking
    stack user, which uses the SDR radio computer to transmit and receive user data."
