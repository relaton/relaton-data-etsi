  content: This WI will add support for NGSO constellations. The operational bandwidth
    of the return link was extended and lower roll-off waveforms were introduced.  Major
    amendments included the addition of DVB-S2X waveforms on the return link, either
    within the TDMA grid or over a continuous carrier, replacing the former continuous
    carrier waveform, which was deprecated.
