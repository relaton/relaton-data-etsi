abstract:
- content: "):   The Service centralization and continuity application server (SCC
    AS) is the entity in the IMS domain that handles the management of the access
    transfer of active sessions. The SCC AS coordinates the proper media and signalling
    exchange to the access network in which the UE is present. IMS centralized services
    (ICS) allow for centralizing IMS services regardless of whether the mode of the
    mobile network is circuit-switched (CS) or packet-switched (PS). The ICS function
    introduces a new entity in the IMS network, the service centralization and continuity
    application server (SCC AS). The SCC AS entity combines the SIP signalling and
    acts as a back-to-back user agent (B2BUA), providing an anchor point for incoming
    and outgoing calls. This conformance test specification aims to verify the SIP
    Protocol over the ISC reference point. "
