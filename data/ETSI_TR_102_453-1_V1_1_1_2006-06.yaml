abstract:
- content: "Novelty and market impact of a fixed-nomadic system\r\nTechnical and functional
    system description \r\nIntra-system interference scenarios between fixed and nomadic
    users, using directional and omni antennae respectively\r\nPropose target frequencies
    for sharing studies\r\nPropose innovative approaches for interference mitigation
    with other spectrum users\r\nPart 1 addresses frequencies above 3 400 MHz, regognising
    that established frequency bands already identified within the ECC framework for
    BFWA and/or P-MP (e.g. 3.4GHz-3.6GHz), and additionally, interest in adjacent
    frequency bands, specifically up to 4.2GHz has been identified"
