abstract:
- content: To provide a comparison of some proposals in the academic literature for
    quantum-safe key exchange schemes. We will provide an overview of a representative
    selection of isogeny-based, Learning With Errors (LWE), Ring-LWE and HIMMO schemes
    and study security, efficiency, parameterisations and practical implementation
    issues.
