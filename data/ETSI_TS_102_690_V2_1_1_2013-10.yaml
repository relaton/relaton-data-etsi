  content: This stage 2 working item will describe the M2M functional architecture
    to deliver M2M services to applications. It will describe the functional elements
    and provide normative references to standards already addressed in other ETSI
    TB or other organizations such as 3GPP or IETF. It will be based on a companion
    document on service requirements. A description of each functional element as
    well as the high level call flow will be provided. This may serve as a basis for
    liaison with other organizations to influence their work in accordance to the
    defined architecture or trigger stage 3 work in ETSI M2M. Smart Metering will
    be covered by this architecture.
