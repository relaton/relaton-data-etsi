  content: "considering the request of draft mandate in support of Commission Regulation
    (EU) 2019/424 (The regulation)  the document will be a new energy efficiency measurement
    methods and metrics to support data storage as defined in \"the regulation\".\r\nTo
    define measurement methods for: 1) online storage, 2) nearline storage including
    HW and system.  \r\nNOTE: the standard for energy efficiency of storage is different
    with servers. For storage it is important to evaluate the performance of IO, while
    the server is mainly to evaluate the performance of computing.\r\nThe standard
    will consider SNIA document on energy efficiency of Storage Equipment\r\n"
