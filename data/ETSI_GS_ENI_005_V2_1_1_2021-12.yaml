abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this work item is to draft a GS to revise and enhance the
    specification of the software functional architecture of ENI. This work uses as
    its foundation the Functional Blocks and Reference Points defined in the first
    release of GS ENI 005. \r\nThis work item is organised around three efforts. The
    first is to further specify the functional blocks of the ENI System Architecture;
    the second is to define how model-driven principles are used to define key concepts
    used by ENI functional blocks; the third is to expand and detail interaction with
    other SDO Systems.\r\nThis work includes: \r\n- specification of External Reference
    Points,\r\n- specification of APIs for each External Reference Point,\r\n- specification
    of Interfaces for each API,\r\n- specification of formal semantics,\r\n- specification
    of cognition processes,\r\n- specification of how closed control loops are realised
    using functional blocks and appropriate AI mechanisms,\r\n- specification of model-driven
    principles and procedures that show how the (single) information model is created
    and maintained,\r\n- specification of model-driven principles and procedures that
    show how (multiple) data models are derived from the (single) information model,\r\n-
    definition of how  functional blocks are able to work collaboratively to implement
    desired functionality,\r\n- definition of how context, situation-awareness, cognition,
    and policy are built using model-driven principles and procedures,\r\n- definition
    of how knowledge is represented, managed, and processed,\r\n- definition of more
    detailed interaction with various Assisted Systems in particular reference standard
    \ architectures as  NFV MANO , MEF LSO, BBF CloudCO, ZSM,3GPP5G, etc.\r\nSoftware
    architecture, in terms of functional blocks, and related interactions will be
    addressed to the extent needed for the implementation of the ENI functionalities.\r\nFurther
    enhancements that will be provided by Release 2 that may be found in ยง9 of GS
    ENI 005 v1.1.1.\r\n"
