  content: This Harmonized Standard for two-way communications in the S-bands specifies
    the essential requirements due to the R&TTE (article 3.2) Directive for Satellite
    Earth Station Terminals operating as part of a satellite network. These Earth
    Stations (or the satellite part of multi mode terminals) operate in the frequency
    band allocated to the Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) on a primary basis, 2170
    to 2200 MHz (space-to-earth) and 1980 to 2010 MHz (earth-to-space) . During the
    drafting of the Harmonized Standard the work should consider EN 301 908 and review
    its applicability to S-UMTS.
