  content: 'This SRdoc is restricted to RDI-S devices (ECC Report 334) and will consider
    the following points: Radio Regulations currently without allocations to radiocommunication
    services; RR footnotes 5.564A and 5.565; studies ongoing at ITU-R level since
    WRC-19 (Resolution 663) from 231,5-1000 GHz; review expected at WRC-23, finalisation
    at WRC-27; avoid any overlap/impact of RDI-S to ITU-R work on Res 663. RDI-S devices
    should be based on article 4.4 of the ITU Radio Regulations.'
