abstract:
- content: This work item will develop the interoperability and conformance test suite
    for the Home Gateway TS, extending from provisions in TS 103 701 and within the
    family of standards derived from EN 303 645. The test suite will address each
    of the (Protocol) Conformance Implementation Statement (PICS), Test Suite Structure
    and Test Purposes (TSS&TP), the Abstract Test Suite containing, where appropriate,
    the TTCN defined tests, and the PIXIT (additional information for implementing
    the tests). The test suite is designed for all necessary parts of the supply chain
    to allow for testing by manufacturers or by independent test houses. The coverage
    of the test suite will follow the scope of the reference core specification (HG
    TS) and will inherit and extend from the test suite for consumer IoT (i.e. will
    be an extension and specialisation of TS 103 701 for the HG case addressing the
    same scope of testing).The test suite will initially be developed in parallel
    to the HG TS to maximise the testability of provisions in the HG TS .
