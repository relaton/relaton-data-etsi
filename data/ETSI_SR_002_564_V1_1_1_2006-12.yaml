  content: "eHealth related work has been done in several ETSI Technical Bodies: however,
    there is currently no specific committee structure for eHealth standardization
    work. It is felt that the importance of the subject matter could justify the creation
    of a new ETSI Technical Body, but before taking this step, it is necessary to
    further analyse the work to be performed. \r\nThe present document provides the
    results of an analysis of the applicability of existing ETSI and ETSI/3GPP deliverables
    for eHealth matters, and specifies the need for further work in this area. Based
    upon the present document, further actions may be undertaken.\r\n"
