  content: To describe a set of best practice design principles for Privileged Access
    Workstations (PAWs) that would benefit the Telecoms Industry, amongst others.
    PAWs can mitigate a large number of security threats and can reduce the attack
    surface of an Operator, their vendors and service providers. Standardization of
    these principles will provide greater consistency, ensure that costs can be reduced
    for all parties and will help to create a common understanding for implementation.
