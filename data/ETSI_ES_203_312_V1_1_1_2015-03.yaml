abstract:
- content: "This ES describes a method for distributed deployment and centralized
    control of a DOCSIS cable broadband access system, referred to as \"C-DOCSIS\".
    It has been developed to meet the operability and manageability requirements for
    cable networks that offer a variety of high-bandwidth services and provide QoS
    guarantees for these services in a distributed architecture. This architecture
    applies to the operations, administration and management (OAM) of cable broadband
    access networks.\r\nThis ES defines the functional modules within the CMTS, three
    different system architectures utilizing the functional modules, and the data
    and control interfaces between these modules for each of those architectures.
    It also defines general device requirements for the different distributed CMTS
    architectures."
