abstract:
- content: "Clarifications about remarks and notes made by GROW-RED (ref. Ares(2020)5066773)
    for publishing V3.2.2 in the OJEU.\r\nTo introduce the relevant material studied
    under the scope of MI work Items DMI-0445, DMI-0439 and DMI-0446. Major arguments
    as follows:\r\n• Alignment of unwanted emission requirement to 2019 revision of
    ERC/REC 74-01\r\n• Introduction of CS=80 MHz in U6 and 11 GHz band\r\n• Reduction
    (down to 30 dBi) antenna gain in Eband.\r\n• Reinstating CS=20 MHz data in U6
    band (left over for mistake in previous version)\r\n• Clarification on spectrum
    mask applicability for systems <3 GHz (annex B)\r\n• Extension of “channels-aggregation”
    equipment to more than 2 channels \r\n• Removing inconsistent Frequency tolerance
    for CS<250 MHz in bands > 70 GHz\r\n• Clarification on dynamic spectrum mask testing
    for mixed-mode and bandwidth-adaptive equipment.\r\n• Other miscellaneous clarifications.\r\nTo
    include parameters for CS=220/224 MHz in bands from 18 to 42 GHz"
