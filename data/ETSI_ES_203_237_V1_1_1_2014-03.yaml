  content: "The Green Abstraction Layer (GAL) is an architectural interface/middleware
    that will give a flexible access to the power management capabilities of the future
    energy aware telecommunication fixed network nodes to effectively exploit the
    capability of adapting the energy consumption of the network nodes with respect
    to the load variations. \r\nThe GAL, is intended to synthetize and to correctly
    expose power management capabilities and corresponding consumption variation.\r\nIn
    this respect the specific objective of this WI will be:\r\n1) the definition of
    the Green Abstract Layer general architecture.\r\n2) the definition of the interoperable
    interface (Convergence Layer Interface) between the Network Control Protocols
    (NCP, for the energy efficiency purpose) and the power management capabilities
    of the fixed network devices and the corresponding iterative handshake protocol.\r\n3)
    the definition of the Energy States describing the different configurations and
    corresponding performances with respect to energy consumptions of the devices.\r\n
    See the document EE(12)41_016 for more detailed information about GAL and the
    Motivations/objectives of this WI."
