  content: "The scope of this study item is proposed to cover functional architecture
    and interfaces of an SDR equipment, which can operate multiple radios in parallel
    by sharing the baseband computation, RF and spectrum resources efficiently.  Such
    architecture is expected to provide two system-level interfaces:\r\nMultiradio
    access interface that provisions all SDR multiradio services such as data communication
    and reconfiguration to the applications residing in the handset \r\nUnified radio
    system interface for harmonizing the way, in which different and independently
    standardized radio stacks can operate simultaneously under a common SDR control
    framework"
