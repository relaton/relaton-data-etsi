  content: "Following experience gained in its use to date and noting recent discussions,
    review and revise the guide to:\r\n1.\tProvide informative guidance on which receiver
    parameters may be considered the most relevant depending on the type of device
    (e.g. SRDs, unlicensed, licensed) and the underlying spectrum regulatory environment,
    including changes to that environment.\r\n2.\tClarify the text on the selection
    of parameters to demonstrate that the guide is advisory as opposed to prescriptive.\r\n3.\tProvide
    guidance in regards to minuting decisions and background (justification) of where
    and where not specific parameters (especailly receiver parameters) are included.\r\n4.\tAdd
    specific guidance on which receiver parameters should be considered depending
    on specific technologies (e.g.  Radiodetermination, UWB and Satellite Ground Components)
    as these may differ from the classical parameter set currently contained with
    the guide\r\n5.\tAdd guidance describing the revised structure of the ETSI EMC
    standards.\r\n\r\nNo parameters will be deleted from the current version\r\n\r\nThis
    guide will focus soley on the Radio Equipment Directive and not cover requirements
    and processes applicable to harmonised standards produced in support of earlier
    regulatory regimes.\r\n"
