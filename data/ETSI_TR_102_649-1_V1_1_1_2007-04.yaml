  content: "This part will propose changes to the existing regulation in ERC REC 70-03.
    The present document will also identify the spectrum requirements for RFID operating
    in the UHF frequency band. \r\nA wide variety of RFID applications are anticipated,
    such as automatic article identification, asset tracking, airline baggage handling,
    management of logistics, security and alarm systems, waste management, proximity
    sensors, anti-theft systems, location systems, data transfer to handheld devices
    and wireless control systems. The development of devices based on ultra high frequency
    (UHF) RFID in the EC will contribute to development of the information society
    and to the promotion of innovation. \r\n"
