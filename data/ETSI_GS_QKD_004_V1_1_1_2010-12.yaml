abstract:
- content: The application interface of a QKD System is the interface over which it
    is attached to a cryptographic information and communication (ICT) system. Existing
    ICT systems shall be evaluated to address the compatibility aspect, especially
    for handing over cryptographic keys and key distribution system management. It
    shall be analysed which particularities of QKD systems lead to additional requirements
    on these interfaces.
