abstract:
- content: "Industrial domain is expectd to be able to improve efficiency and flexibility
    by utilizing ICT technology: collecting data from devices in multiple factories,
    analyzing them, and applying the analysis results to decisions. So, it is desirable
    to utilize oneM2M standardized technology in the industrial domain.  To better
    understand the special requirements to support the operations of the industrial
    environment, it is desirable to conduct studies on various functionalities that
    are keen to support this purpose so as to identify necessary technical works to
    enhance the future oneM2M specifications.  This work item is intended to study
    such functionalities and the results of that study will be presented in a Technical
    Report.\r\nOnce the study has concluded, the work item may need to be enhanced
    to include normative work in future releases of oneM2M specifications.\r\nInitially,
    the targeted functionalities to be studied include:\r\n(1) Balancing of availability/processing
    of data: \r\nThis functionality will provide basis to select an optimized solution
    dealing with data collection complexity and the processing means between an “intra
    factory” and an “inter factories” environments. \r\n\r\n(2) Data processing model
    between real-time operating environments through a remote server: \r\nMany devices
    in a factory work autonomously and communicate with each other (e.g. over high
    speed industry buses) in a real-time fashion. However, a remote server (e.g. a
    server in the Cloud) can be used to support analytical work off-line in an inter-factories
    environment. The present work item will study how a remote server service can
    be provided to support these devices in factories.\r\n\r\n(3)Reliability of data
    transmission/aggregation.\r\nIn factory applications, the quality of the manufacturing
    process is highly depending on the accuracy of the data, which can be greatly
    affected with the reliability of the communications among devices and the server.
    So, means of monitoring the data flow and integrity is needed in order to keep
    the manufacturing work effectively.\r\n"
