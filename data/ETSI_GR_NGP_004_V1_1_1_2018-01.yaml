abstract:
- content: This work item focuses on using  Identity Oriented Networks (ION) for next
    generation architectures toward 5G and beyond. The basic concept and goal behind
    ION is to dis-associate the permanent identity and temporal location information
    for an entity. Ideally this goal should be whilst also being able to be used to
    support current architectures whilst at the same time as enabling more optimal
    future architectures. The work aims to examine and propose recommendations to
    improve and simplify the network infrastructure and its mobility, by adopting
    by using ION. In addition, the work item  may require the development of new protocols
    and/ or modification of existing protocols.
