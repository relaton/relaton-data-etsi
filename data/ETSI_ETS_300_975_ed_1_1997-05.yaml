  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) identifies the Interwor\r\nking
    Functions (IWF s) and requirements for the interworking between a\r\nGSM PLMN
    and a Packet Switched Public Data Network/Integrated Service\r\ns Digital Network
    (PSPDN/ISDN) for the support of packet services in G\r\nSM PLMNs.\r\nIn the GSM
    PLMN context the packet services are associated with bearer\r\nservices and are
    described in GSM 02.02. The generally defined GSM PL\r\nMN user-network access
    as defined in the respective GSM specifications\r\n(see references) forms the
    basis for defining the particularities for\r\nthe provision of packet services
    to the GSM PLMN subscribers. Network\r\ninternal interfaces for the support of
    packet services in the pan-Eur\r\nopean ISDN are defined in ETSI standards, which
    are also taken as a ba\r\nsis.\r\nUser-network access and network internal interfaces
    are defined to pro\r\nvide the packet services.\r\n"
