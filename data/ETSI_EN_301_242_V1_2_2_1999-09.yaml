abstract:
- content: "To secify radio and network aspects related to dual-mode terminals.\r\nThis
    EN will, in conjuction with other standards and TBRs, form the basis for the second
    edition of TBR 39 (converted to Harmonized EN 301 439 v1.2.x), i.e. basic dual-mode
    terminals that only consist of a DECT art and a GSM part and that may automatically
    switch between DECT and GSM modes. (Advanced dual-mode terminals, where the DECT
    and GSM parts are further integrated, will be considered in a TR (DTR/DECT-010096).\r\nThe
    same considerations apply for dual-mode DECT/DCS1800 terminals and for DECT/GSM/DCS1800
    dual mode/dual band terminals. The term GSM is considered to cover all the frequency
    bands, and combinations of frequency bands allowed for GSM type equipment, i.e.
    P-GSM, E-GSM, R-GSM, DCS1800 or dual band GSM/DCS.\r\n\r\nReference documents:
