abstract:
- content: "This revision of ETSI GS NFV-SOL018 continues the development of the specification
    as part of the Release 4 and applies maintenance changes where applicable. This
    edition will also add updates according to latest published versions of the reference
    open source APIs and data model solutions related to daemon sets. The scope of
    the former edition is summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nThe work item provides a mapping
    of the NFV object model for OS container management and orchestration to managed
    objects of Kubernetes速 and Helm(TM) as specified by the CNCF速 along with a specification
    of a mapping between a common set of input parameters (e.g., derived from VNFD/NSD
    and/or NFV-MANO RESTful APIs) and output parameters associated to the management
    and orchestration of the referred managed objects.\r\nIt profiles the reference
    Kubernetes速 API, Helm(TM) documentation and Docker(TM) registry API as NFV protocol
    and data model solution for OS container management and orchestration, OS container
    workload based on an MCIOP, OS container image management, CIS instance management
    and management of Managed CIS Cluster Objects (MCCO). \r\nThe latest published
    versions of the reference Kubernetes速 API, Helm(TM) documentation and Docker(TM)
    registry API are profiled against the requirements on the functions and the management
    service interfaces of the Container Infrastructure Service Management (CISM) and
    Container Image Registry (CIR) functions as specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040,
    ETSI GS NFV-IFA 036 and ETSI GS NFV-IFA 010. \r\n"
