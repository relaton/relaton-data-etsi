  content: The present document specifies the high level O-RAN slicing related use
    cases, requirements and architecture. While some of the requirements are derived
    from use cases, some of the relevant SDO requirements are captured as they have
    impact on O-RAN functions. Along with requirements and reference slicing architecture,
    slicing related impact to O-RAN functions and interfaces are also captured.
