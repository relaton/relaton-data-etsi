  content: In the proposed WI some MW backhauling solutions for Small Cell will be
    studied in order to investigate the possible impacts to TM4 standard documentations.
    The starting point is represented by the definition of Small Cell from Mobile
    Operators and Literature and the characterization of one or more (maximum three)
    deployment scenario(s) by TM4. More detailed description of the arguments in the
    scope is reported in document ATTMTM4(13)000014a1r1.  Preliminary studies, based
    on recognized Small Cell backhauling requirements, would be carried on within
    TM4 and, whenever encouraging results happen, SE19 should be involved for possible
    review of the issue from regulatory point of view.  Frequency bands from FS allocated
    sub 6 GHz, as far their availability, for this scope, is recognised (e.g. in-band
    backhauling when also MS is co-primary) , trough traditionally coordinated MW
    bands (6-56 GHz) and up to mmWV (above 57 GHz) are inside TR scope. Satellite,
    White Space, WiFi applications and frequency bands together with Wired solutions
    are considered out of TR scope.    Recently EC is studying the possibility to
    extend 5 GHz frequency band (from 5.725 to 5.925 GHz) to RLAN application. This
    fact should be carefully considered in case of deploying FS in these bands.
