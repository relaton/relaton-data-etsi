  content: Define a GRID testing working framework (tests and validation methodologies,
    approach and tools to be used. By example, propose to re-use the tools developed
    by MTS-IPT to create easily a Requirement Catalogue able to transform existing
    ICT GRID specifications into tests requirements standards corresponding to selected
