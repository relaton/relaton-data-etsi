  content: Specification of external encodings for the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES); the objective of the encodings is to increase the resistance of white-box
    AES implementations against attacks based on differential computation analysis
    and differential fault analysis; the work will take the applicability of the encodings
    to other block ciphers into account
