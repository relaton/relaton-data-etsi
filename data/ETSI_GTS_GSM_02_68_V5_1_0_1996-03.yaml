abstract:
- content: "This GSM Technical Specification (GTS) specifies the stage one\r\ndescription
    of the Voice Group Call Service (VGCS) which allows speech\r\nconversation of
    a predefined group of service subscribers in half\r\nduplex mode on the radio
    link taking into account multiple mobile\r\nservice subscribers involved in the
    VGCS call per cell.\r\nThe VGCS is applicable to all mobile stations in a certain
    network and\r\narea which have the technical capability and the corresponding\r\nsubscription,
    respectively, to participate in a VGCS call.\r\nNOTE: It is not considered as
    requirement that normal GSM phase 2\r\nmobile stations will be able to be used
    for this service.\r\nThe service is described from the service subscriber s and
    user s\r\npoint of view; in particular:\r\n- the procedure for normal operation
    with successful outcome;\r\n- the action to be taken in exceptional circumstances;\r\n-
    the interaction with other GSM services and features.\r\n This specification does
    not deal with the Man-Machine Interface (MMI)\r\nrequirements, but makes reference
    to the appropriate Global System for\r\nMobile Communications (GSM) specifications.\r\nThis
    specification defines a teleservice of the digital cellular\r\ntelecommunications
    system GSM. Any interaction with other services\r\nand/or networks not dealt with
    in clauses 8 or 9 are outside the scope\r\nof this specification.\r\n "
