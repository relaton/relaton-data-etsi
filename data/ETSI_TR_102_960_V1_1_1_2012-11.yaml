  content: Without the use of special mitigation techniques, European CEN Dedicated
    Short Range Communication (DSRC) equipment operating in the frequency range from
    5 795 MHz to 5 815 MHz might suffer from harmful interference caused by Intelligent
    Transport Systems (ITS) using adjacent frequency bands. The produced Technical
    Report (TR) will evaluate the detailed need of mitigation techniques and the corresponding
    parameters to avoid this interference. The evaluation will be based on simulation
    and measurements.
