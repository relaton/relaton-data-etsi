abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidelines and recommendations for the implemen\r\ntation
    of an Interaction Channel based on two way satellite links, to\r\nusers connected
    to Satellite Master Antenna Television (SMATV) systems\r\n.\r\nThe system provides
    the Interaction Channel through the concatenation\r\nof a Satellite section and
    a Coaxial section (see figure 1) in a sea\r\nmless fashion. Guidelines and recommendations
    here provided are valid\r\nfor the implementation of very cost effective solutions
    matched to the\r\nSMATV scenario as well as for the reuse of already operating
    satellit\r\ne networks which are currently installed in a huge amount of buildings\r\nthroughout
    Europe.\r\n "
