abstract:
- content: "The DVB In-home Digital Network (IHDN) can be subdivided into a Home Access
    Network (HAN) for the connection to external networks and a Home Local Network
    (HLN) for interconnections of user equipment to clusters and between rooms.\r\nIn
    addition to the DVB access technologies DVB-S, DVB-C, DVB-T, DVB-SMATV, DVB-MC
    and DVB-MS (EN 300 421/429/744/473/748/749) with the interaction channels for
    interactive broadcast services (EN/ETS 300 800/801/802/(1)195/199/205), the IHDN-HAN
    specification will focus on the definition of new interfaces and network terminations
    (NT), such as an xDSL modem or an external cable modem. The existing DVB transmission
    systems form part of the HAN architecture, but access the IRD without any influence
    from other sections of the HAN.\r\nDifferent versions of HAN are possible. The
    HAN for use with an active NT is based on an ATM interface operating at 25 or
    51 Mbps. The IEEE 1394 interface with the long reach extension has been selected
    for the HLN.\r\nExtension of the DVB interactive systems reference model with
    the IHDN. The network clouds show logically the association to corresponding services
    (broadcast, interactive broadcast, interactive multimedia services). Physically
    they may overlap and not all of them may be used in parallel. The broadband access
    network is new; which enables broadband multimedia services, such as video on
    demand and switched digital broadcast, over twisted pair lines with an xDSL modem.
    It may also be used for interaction purposes in combination with any broadcast
    delivery network. \r\n\r\n"
