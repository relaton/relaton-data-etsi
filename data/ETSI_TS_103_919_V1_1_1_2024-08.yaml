  content: This requires the involvement of originating devices and PSAPs which are
    the sources and sinks of multimedia communication and must support the corresponding
    codecs. In between, networks and services are needed to connect signalling and
    media streams to the right PSAP. All necessary requirements concerning PSAPs (signalling
    and media support) will be listed and, if necessary, the content of referenced
    standards will be supplemented.
