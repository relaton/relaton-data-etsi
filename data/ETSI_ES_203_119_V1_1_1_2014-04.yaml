abstract:
- content: This document defines a new, graphical notation for the specification of
    test descriptions and the presentation of test execution results based on sequence
    charts primarily for the purpose of functional testing, but also potentially other
    types of testing. The abstraction level of test descriptions specified in this
    notation should be similar to test purposes, i.e., they enable the specification
    of tests on top of TTCN-3 frameworks and can be produced as output from model-based
    test generators.
