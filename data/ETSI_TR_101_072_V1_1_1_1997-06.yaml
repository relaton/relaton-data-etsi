abstract:
- content: "To investigate radio and network aspects and clarifying the\r\npossibilities
    as well as the problems related to dual-mode terminals.\r\nThis TR will describe
    how existing DECT and GSM standards and TBRs can\r\nform the basis for the first
    edition of TBR 39, i.e. basic dual-mode\r\nterminals that only consist of a DECT
    part and a GSM part and that may\r\nautomatically switch between DECT and GSM
    modes. (Advanced dual-mode\r\nterminals, where the DECT and GSM parts are further
    integrated, will\r\nbe considered in another TR (DTR/DECT-010096).\r\n The same
    considerations apply for dual-mode DECT/DCS1800 terminals and\r\nfor DECT/GSM/DCS1800
    dual mode/dual band terminals. The term GSM is c\r\nonsidered to cover all the
    frequency bands, and combinations of freque\r\nncy bands allowed for GSM type
    equipment, i.e. P-GSM, E-GSM, R-GSM, DC\r\nS1800 or dual band GSM/DCS.\r\n The
    need for further standardization should be identified, especially\r\nthe contents
    of an eventual ETS as the basis for the first edition of\r\nTBR 39.\r\n  "
