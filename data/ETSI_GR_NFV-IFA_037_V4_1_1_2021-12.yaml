abstract:
- content: This work item will investigate the impacts on NFV to support deployments
    of 5G networks. It will assess the 5G network capabilities and features, and determine
    how NFV can provide a better support to facilitate the implementation and deployment
    of such networks by enhancing and/or profiling NFV capabilities/features. The
    deliverable that will be produced is expected to provide recommendations on how
    the NFV architectural framework and its functionality can be utilized and further
    enhanced to address the 5G network use cases. The resulting deliverable will be
    informative.
