  content: "The present document provides information on the intended applications,
    the technical parameters, the relation to the existing spectrum regulation and
    additional new radio spectrum requirements for NMR based equipment. The present
    document includes necessary information to support the co-operation between ETSI
    and the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European Conference of
    Post and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), including:  Detailed market
    information (annex A);  Technical information (annex B);  Relation to existing
    spectrum regulation (annex C);  Expected compatibility issues (annex D). Requirements
    on the devices for the intended applications are e.g. frequencies in the range
    1 to 50 MHz with the usage of use-case dependent mitigation techniques.\r\nThe
    work will be done in ERM TG28."
