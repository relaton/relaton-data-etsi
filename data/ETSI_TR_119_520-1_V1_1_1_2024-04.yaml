  content: "This document will define the new framework of standards that specify
    ERDS and REM, identifying the most relevant changes to be performed in the framework
    currently existing, among which, the incorporation of an ERDS HTTP-based baseline,
    offering similar features than REM baseline but on HTTP-based protocols; those
    ones due to the changes brought by eIDAS 2.0 (including new components such as
    the EU eWallet, and the Electronic Attribute Attestations); and those ones due
    to emerging technologies that might have an impact in this field. \r\nIt will
    also contain recommendations for updating ETSI TR 119 000 and ETSI TR 119 001.\r\nFinally,
    this document will also identify the issues that may impact the policy and security
    requirements standard.\r\n"
