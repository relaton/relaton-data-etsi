abstract:
- content: "The objective of this WI is to analyse the set of codecs supported by
    TISPAN-based CNDs for NGN services, on the basis of the service requirements contained
    in TS 181 005 and TS 185 005, and with reference to the CNDs architecture defined
    in TS 185 006 (for communication services) and TS 185 009 (for IPTV services).
    Additional requirements for devices defined by other SDO's are out of the scope
    of the WI.\r\nWork will address AV/broadcast codecs for IPTV and Conversational
    codecs for telephony services. \r\nFor conversational codecs, the analysis must
    be fully consistent with and limited  to the set of codecs identified in TS 181
    005.  In particular for conversational codecs the status will not be changed except
    in case of upgrade to mandatory. \r\nFor each service (person to person communication
    and IPTV) work will be focused on analysing the possibility to create subsets
    of default/mandatory codecs which is the only way to guarantee interoperability
    and avoid transcoding."
