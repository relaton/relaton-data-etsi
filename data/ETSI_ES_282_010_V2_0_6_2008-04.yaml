abstract:
- content: "Charging in R2 covers the following issues:\r\n·Online charging\r\n·Charging
    of new services\r\n·Coordination with RACS, in order to provide RACS support of
    charging.\r\nNote: \r\nOnline Charging also comprises a correlation between online
    charging and AoC, as well as realtime transfer of tariff information through NNI-interfaces
    (SIP-SIP and SIP-ISUP).\r\nCharging of new services needs to be triggered by service-related
    requirements (e.g. IPTV, FMC) or architecture enhancements \r\n(e.g. IBCF Functionality
    in interconnection scenarios)\r\n"
