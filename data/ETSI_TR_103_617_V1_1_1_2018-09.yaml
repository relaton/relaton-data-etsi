abstract:
- content: To provide a review and recommendations on the impacts of integrating quantum
    safe algorithms into VPN technologies.  We will focus on VPN technologies commonly
    used and emerging VPN protocols.  We will include a discussion of the use of hybrid
    schemes to allow efficient and practical use of traditional cryptography with
    quantum safe cryptography.  Recommendations will include protocol changes, algorithm
    formats, efficiency and implementation considerations.
