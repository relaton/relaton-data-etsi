  content: "The scope of this work item is to specify the architecture and functions
    of an IPTV system by incorporating IPTV functions within the NGN architecture.
    For example, interactions and information flows between the IPTV system with other
    entities will be specified.\r\nFocus should be on integrating IPTV solutions (such
    as those defined by DVB, ATIS IIF etc) with the NGN architecture.\r\nThe resulting
    architecture should, by relying as much as possible on common components, coexist
    with other TISPAN NGN services.\r\nFor example, attention should be given to the
    following:\r\nAuthentication and authorisation\r\nContent Protection (including
    DRM)\r\nCapability exchange\r\nResource Management\r\nPolicy Management\r\nCharging
    \r\nUser Profiles\r\n"
