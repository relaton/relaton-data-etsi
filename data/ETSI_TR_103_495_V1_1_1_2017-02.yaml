abstract:
- content: Instantiation of the Reference Model for Autonomic Networking, Cognition
    and Self-Management  onto the Ad-Hoc/Mesh/Sensor architecture (IEEE Std. 802.11
    and IEEE Std. 802.16 ) by superimposing GANA Decision Elements (DEs) into node/device
    architectures and the overall network architecture, so that the DEs and their
    associated Control-Loops can be further designed to perform autonomic management
    and control of the specific resources (Managed Entities) in the target architecture.
    Recommendations on the basic behaviours of the GANA Functional Blocks (FBs) in
    the above context will be developed.
