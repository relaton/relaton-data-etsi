  content: "This work provides a variant specification of the EG 202 396-3 and TS
    103 106 ETSI models for superwideband and fullband terminals, including training
    and validation for new codecs, voice enhancements and background noise conditions.\r\nThis
    revision was created to take into account the work in 3GPP SA4 and other contributions
    on Speech quality in the presence of ambient noise for super-wideband and fullband
    modes."
