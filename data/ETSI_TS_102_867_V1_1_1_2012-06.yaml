    to the EU/ETSI architecture for ITS security. In addition to endorsing IEEE 1609.2
    for the EU market this work item is to show how the countermeasures map to the
    wider capability of ITS and shall illustrate and define extensions or modifications
    to IEEE 1609.2 to ensure that key are fully managed in the overall context of
    EU/ETSI ITS. The work should be shared with IEEE, ISO TC204 and with the industry
    partners to the ETSI ITS programme.
