  content: "The work item will encompass activities related to real-time management
    and orchestration of ultra low latency services. \r\nThis work item covers  \r\n
    \          -  Definition of relevant use cases (potentially from any of the following
    areas: Automotive industry, health care, entertainment and gaming)\r\n           -
    Analysis of the NFV MANO architectural framework including interfaces regarding
    gaps to support the real-time realisation of such use cases \r\n           -  Provision
    of recommendations concerning adaption of the NFV architecture, if necessary \r\n
    \          -  Provision of  recommendations for the update of existing interfaces
    and/or the creation of new interface(s), if necessary.  The work and the deliverable
    will be informative."
