abstract:
- content: The present document contains material relating to takedown requests. The
    present document contains a statement of benefits for using standardised interfaces
    for take-down requests. The present document contains use cases, examples and
    scenarios and brings these together into certain categories (the goal is that
    all scenarios in the same category can be handled in a similar way). The present
    document present suggestions around potential requirements (though does not formally
    define requirements). For each category, the present document highlights some
    potential approaches i.e. ways to achieve the benefits for the scenarios identified.
    The approaches considered include creating new standards and creating Change Requests
    against existing standards.
