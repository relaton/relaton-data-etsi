abstract:
- content: "The scope of the work item is to define an interworking of both standards
    oneM2M and OGC SensorThings API.\r\nThe interworking solution shall be designed
    and follow the principles applied too- and in alignment with, already existing
    interworking solution in oneM2M, \r\nThe objectives of the work item are structured
    as followed:\r\n-Describing interworking scenarios that are relvant but not exclusive
    for Smart City (there are also examples from other areas and verticals as well)\r\n-Technical
    comparison of oneM2M and OGC / STA\r\n-Describing a technical solution for interworking
    of both standards; there might be interworking on different level:\r\noopaque
    data routing\r\nodata model mapping between oneM2M-SDT and OGC ISO 19156\r\n-Developing
    test cases for interworking between oneM2M and OGC SensorThings API\r\n\r\nProvide
    corresponding change requests if impacts on existing oneM2M Technical Specifications
    are identified.\r\n"
