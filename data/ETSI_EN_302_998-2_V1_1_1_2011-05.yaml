  content: "To prepare Part 2, Test Arrangements for transmitters utilising OFDM technology,
    of a multi-part Harmonised EN covering the essential requirements of transmitting
    equipment for terrestrial mobile TV to provide multimedia multicast service operating
    in CEPT or national frequency bands appropriate for this service. It is intended
    to cover the provisions of Directive 1999/5/EC (R&TTE Directive) Article 3.2,
    which states that: \"... radio equipment shall be so constructed that it effectively
    uses the spectrum allocated to terrestrial/space radio communications and orbital
    resources so as to avoid harmful interference\".\r\nThis Harmonised standard excludes
    from its scope equipment falling within the scope of EN 301 908.."
