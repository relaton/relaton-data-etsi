abstract:
- content: "This EN specifies the technical requirements to be met by terminal equipment
    capable of connecting to a public telecommunications network and that support
    the ASCI feature. These requirements apply to terminals for Phase 2+ of the public
    land mobile radio service, operating in the 900 MHz band with a channel separation
    of 200 kHz, utilising constant envelope modulation and carrying traffic channels
    according to the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) principle.\r\nThis EN specifies
    the terminal equipment ASCI requirements for the GSM 900 version of the Global
    System for Mobile communications (GSM).\r\nFor each test purpose and its corresponding
    conformance requirement, a reference is given to the test method in EN 300 607-1
    (GSM 11.10-1) [2]. The requirements apply at the air interface and the Subscriber
    Identity Module - Mobile Equipment interface for the access requirements, which
    may be stimulated to perform the tests by additional equipment if necessary.\r\nThe
    measurement uncertainty is described in EN 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2].\r\nThis
    EN covers the essential requirements of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1]
    Articles 4d, 4e, 4f. \r\nThe Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1] Articles 4a and
    4b are covered by other directives, and, therefore, not by this EN.\r\nIn this
    EN, there are no Electromagnetic Compatibility technical requirements in terms
    of the Terminal Directive 91/263/EEC [1], Article 4c.\r\nNOTE 1:Technical Requirements
    for EMC performance and testing of the equipment are covered by the relevant standards
    applicable to the EMC Directive 89/336/EEC, annex A.\r\nThis module specifies
    the ASCI Terminal equipment additional requirements. \r\nEN 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2]
    constitutes the conformance test suite for GSM. The verification of the conformance
    requirements in this EN is based on the tests described in this reference. The
    set of requirements in EN 300 607-1 (GSM 11.10-1) [2] and the set of requirements
    in this EN need not be identical.\r\nAll the requirements in this EN are specific
    to mobile stations supporting ASCI\r\nAn active accessory is covered by this EN
    if it modifies the terminal performance in an aspect which affects conformance
    to essential requirements.\r\nNOTE 2:Only active devices are subject to this EN.
    Accessories may be tested with specific terminals, and either approved for use
    with those terminals only, or may possibly be approved for use with a wider range
    of terminals, depending on the nature and effect of the accessory.\r\n"
