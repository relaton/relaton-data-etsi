abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) specifies the stage 1\r\ndescription
    of Support of Private Numbering Plan (SPNP), which enables\r\na subscriber to
    use a Private Numbering Plan (PNP) for communication\r\nacross one or more networks
    with mobile and fixed users. The\r\nsubscriber may belong to one or more (up to
    9 maximum) Private\r\nNumbering Plans. The subscriber may also, subject to subscription,\r\nhave
    access to the Public Numbering Plan. The structure and content of\r\neach PNP
    are defined by a PNP Manager, although these are out of scope\r\nof this ETS.\r\nThe
    service is described from the service subscriber s and user s\r\npoints of view;
    in particular:\r\n- the procedures for normal operation with successful outcome;\r\n
    - the action to be taken in exceptional circumstances;\r\n - the interaction with
    other GSM supplementary services.\r\n This ETS does not deal with the Man-Machine
    Interface (MMI)\r\nrequirements, but makes reference to the appropriate Global
    System for\r\nMobile communications (GSM) specifications.\r\nThe charging principles
    applied to Support of Private Numbering Plan\r\n(SPNP) are outside of the scope
    of this ETS.\r\nAny interactions with other services and/or networks not dealt
    with in\r\nClauses 4.1 and 11 to 13 are outside the scope of this ETS.\r\n"
