abstract:
- content: "The scope of this document is to provide the basis for a description of
    the Service aspects of a GSM Cordless Telephony System (CTS), which provides the
    possibility for users of GSM terminals to have cordless access to a fixed network,
    such as PSTN/ISDN.\r\nDue to the time constraints to have a first specification
    ready for market needs, a phased approach is necessary. The first phase focuses
    on the requirements necessary to elaborate the radio interface and the security
    aspects for an application supporting the speech tele-service (including DTMF
    support) in a residential single cell environment. As a consequence, a full business
    environment with all services is not considered. In particular, hand-over between
    CTS fixed parts or between CTS and GSM PLMN is not considered.\r\nThe standardisation
    of the CTS interface towards the fixed network is not a scope of this document.
    However, consideration may need to be given to communication of application data
    between CTS and PLMN via the fixed network.\r\n"
