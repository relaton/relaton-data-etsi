abstract:
- content: 'Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA) signals are able to deliver a significantly
    enhanced immersive sound compared to conventional stereo or 5.1 channel audio
    signals. However, there are some use cases where HOA signals cannot be transported
    because of the large number of HOA input channels. One example is mobile devices,
    where the number of input channels can be limited by 8 Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)
    channels, and thus only a maximum of First Order Ambisonics (FOA: requiring 4
    PCM channels) can be transported. Another example is a typical broadcast workflow.
    The use of single High-Definition Serial Digital Interface (HD-SDI) link has a
    limitation of being able to transport only 16 PCM audio embedded channels. This
    restricts the transport to a maximum of 3rd order HOA signals (requiring 16 PCM
    channels) â€“ and that, only if there are no additional discrete audio elements
    to be transported. If additional audio elements are to be transported, only a
    maximum of 2nd order HOA (requiring 9 PCM channels) can be transported. This work
    item aims to specify a HOA transport format which allows unrestricted HOA order
    signals to be transported.'
