  content: "This revision will be based on up-to-date scientific results on impact
    of specific types of impairments on speech quality predictions provided by current
    objective models, when both naturally-produced and synthesized speech are used.
    In addition, results from new scientific studies and from ITU-T SG12 are expected.
    \r\nOn the basis of the results presented in this TR, final advices to users with
    regard to usage of investigated models in corresponding conditions will be defined.\r\n"
