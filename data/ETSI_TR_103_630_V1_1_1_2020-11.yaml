  content: To study the use cases and requirements of security at the ITS facility
    layer when using the Uu interface of cellular systems. Identify standardization
    activities to be performed to further specify ITS security services & interfaces
    supporting the facility layer for the cellular Uu communication to enable interoperability
    of C-ITS applications.
