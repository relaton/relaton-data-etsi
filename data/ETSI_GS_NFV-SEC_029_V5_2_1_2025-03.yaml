abstract:
- content: The objective of this work item focuses on the security assurance of VIM
    products, which is the part of MANO. The outcome of this WI expects security test
    cases for evaluating the security VIM products. In designing the test cases, the
    security assurance methodology introduced in 3GPP specification will be leveraged.
    Using the security requirements defined in SEC specs (i.e., SEC 014, SEC024, SEC025,
    SEC026, SEC028, etc.) as inputs, security test cases including testing goals,
    testing steps, evidence of testing results will be produced for evaluating if
    the security requirements are fulfilled by VIM products.
