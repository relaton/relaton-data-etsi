abstract:
- content: "The critical infrastructure protection addressed in the EUâ€™s published
    directive is essentially Power and Transport. It is clear to most casual observers
    that the global economic infrastructure is now composed of a huge set of ICT networks
    and services. It would not be a stretch to say that ICT capabilities now underpin
    all of the other critical infrastructures. This means food security, economic
    activity security, citizen safety and just about everything else.\r\n\r\nThe purpose
    of the TR to be delivered by this work item is to identify the role of ICT protections
    through the deployment of security technologies and security management to deliver
    effective Critical Infrastructures that are reliant on ICT technology. The topics
    to be addressed by the work item include: Resilience (taking as input the ENISA
    reports on this topic and work from related national programmes); M2M communications
    (in close liaison with oneM2M and smartM2M); eHealth (in order to give assurance
    of access to ICT enabled eHealth systems). The report is intended to highlight
    aspects of CI and ICT that have to be addressed to ensure that CI maintains its
    infrastructure role.\r\n"
