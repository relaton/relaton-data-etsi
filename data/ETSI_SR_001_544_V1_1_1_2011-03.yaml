abstract:
- content: "The present document presents a summary of the main findings and results
    of ETSI STF 376, on a pro-active approach to SME participation in Standardization.
    \r\nETSI STF 376, co-financed by the European Commission and EFTA and reporting
    to the ETSI Board, has conducted a study into SME participation in ICT standardization,
    evaluating the main benefits of participation and the main barriers which prevent
    SMEs taking a direct role.  A number of case studies were developed of SMEs who
    actively participate in standardization. The present document provides the background
    to the project and describes the methodology used.  It presents the main findings
    from a survey and from the case studies.  It also proposes a number of tools and
    best practices which have been researched and which should support a greater level
    of SME participation in ICT standardization."
