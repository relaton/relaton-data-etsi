  content: 'The purpose of the document is to summarize the available information
    about target simulator for testing radio determination devices.   The document
    will specify  requirements on the target simulator (technical specification figures),
    test environment and additional test equipment   conformance test procedures and
    test set-ups for RX conformance tests (based on the signal interferer handling
    concept) with target simulators.   Note: The usage of target simulators for conformance
    tests is new. Therefore a clear specification is necessary to provide all necessary
    information to test houses to run reproduceable and comparable tests. Furthermore,
    the content of the document could be transferred in future into EN 303 883-2.'
