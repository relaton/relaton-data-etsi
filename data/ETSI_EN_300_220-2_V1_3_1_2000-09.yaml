abstract:
- content: "EN 300 220-1 covers a wide range of telecommunication, telemetry and generic
    non-speech applications, such as alarm systems, identification, detection, remote
    control etc., in the frequency band 25 - 1000 MHz with power levels up to 500
    mW.\r\n\r\nThe work programme is requested to take into account the comments received
    at the Vote stage of the  EN 300 220-1 which were considered as Technical comments
    rather then Editorial and therefore could not be considered.  In addition comments
    have been received on the definition of the Duty Cycle and clarification may be
    necessary.  Similarly, for wideband equipment (subclause 8.6) an investigation
    has been requested into the suitability of the stated value for maximum frequency
    error, currently defined as shall not exceed 10% of the assigned band or wideband
    channel.\r\nBased on the completion of the above investigations, if necessary,
    an amendment to the published EN 300 220-1 will be prepared for approval for publication.\r\n"
