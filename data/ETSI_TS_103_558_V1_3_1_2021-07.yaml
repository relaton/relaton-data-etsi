- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "The present document specifies methods, results and analysis of subjective
    tests for listening effort (and eventually listening quality) at electrical interfaces
    of speech communications, taking into account the effects of noise that originates
    from the transmission chain or from the send side, and of different impairments
    due to the uses and environmental conditions of usage. \r\nNormal hearing listeners
    are considered.\r\nThis revision of the present document is to add the annex E
    on the results of the STF 590 dealing with subjective tests on listening effort.
    A revision of the algorithmic part of TS 103 558 may be needed.\r\n"
