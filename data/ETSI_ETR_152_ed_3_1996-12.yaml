abstract:
- content: "This ETSI Technical Report (ETR) describes a transmission technique ca\r\nlled
    High bit rate Digital Subscriber Line (HDSL), as a means for the\r\ntransportation
    of several types of applications. The ETR defines the r\r\nequirements for the
    individual HDSL transmission system, the transmiss\r\nion performance, the HDSL
    maintenance requirements and procedures and\r\nthe mapping of information from
    the dedicated applications. An individ\r\nual HDSL transceiver system is a two
    wire bidirectional transceiver fo\r\nr metallic wires using the echo cancellation
    method. Three systems may\r\nbe utilized, one transporting a bit rate of 784 kbit/s
    over each of t\r\nhree pairs used in parallel, a second with an increased bit\r\nrate
    of 1 168 kbit/s and two pairs in parallel only and a third with a\r\nmore increased
    bit rate of\r\n2 320 kbit/s on one pair only. The line code of systems specified
    in t\r\nhis ETR is 2B1Q (two Binary one Quaternary). Systems using a CAP (Carr\r\nierless
    Amplitude/Phase modulation) line code are covered in annex B.\r\n"
