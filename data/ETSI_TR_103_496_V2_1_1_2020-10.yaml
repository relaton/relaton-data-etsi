  content: To study how C-ITS architecture and V2X communication technology could
    be used to enable new type of transport pollution control and management applications.
    Based on the identification and analysis of major use cases, the document will
    provide a recommendation for the extension of the existing ETSI ITS standards
    with new ITS applications reducing the environmental transport impact and improving
    the transport pollution control. The document will also include use cases desired
    by road operators.
