abstract:
- content: "This TBR specifies those technical requirements under Articles 4.1 to\r\n4.5
    of Council Directive 93/97/EEC that apply to satellite earth\r\nstation equipment
    that is capable of operation in the following\r\nfrequency ranges:\r\n -\t3,625
    to 4,200 GHz (Space to Earth, shared);\r\n-\t5,850 to 6,425 GHz (Earth to Space,
    shared);\r\n of the Fixed Satellite Service (FSS).\r\nThese requirements are taken
    from:\r\n -\tETS 300 332;\r\n-\tETS 300 333;\r\n-\tETS 300 160.\r\n This TBR does
    not contain the essential requirements under Article 4.6\r\nfor interworking via
    the public telecommunications network in\r\njustified cases, and does not provide
    any guarantee of correct\r\ninterworking between satellite earth station equipment.\r\n
    This TBR specifies the requirements for satellite earth station\r\nequipment that:\r\n
    -\tis capable of being used either for transmission only, or for\r\ntransmission
    and reception (transmit-receive), or for reception only\r\n(receive-only), of
    radio-communications signals in any of the bands\r\nspecified above, and\r\n -\thas
    a diameter of 7,3 m or less;\r\n -\tis not intended for use as part of the public\r\ntelecommunications
    network.\r\n This TBR applies to all satellite equipment as described above,\r\nirrespective
    of whether the satellite earth station equipment provides\r\nadditional interfaces,
    telecommunications services or functions.\r\nHowever additional TBRs may also
    apply.\r\n"
