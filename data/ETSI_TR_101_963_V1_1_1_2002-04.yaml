    and their relative priorities into a Technical Report to form the basis of further
    ETSI work in upgrading DTS-AT-020020-01 specifications to add European specific

    requirements for further enhancement of the current ETSI specifications. Consultation
    with relevant industry bodies external to ETSI will therefore be necessary.
