  content: "The aircraft industry is developing new applications for use on board
    of aircraft. One of the objectives is to offer video on demand to passengers in
    the plane. Such an application requires more channels that those currently available
    in the 5 GHz band. The application is intended for on board of aircraft only and
    only during the flight phase (minimum altitude). This SRDoc aim is to explain
    the above system as well as the likely spectrum demand taking into account global
    allocations for the use of 5 GHz RLAN on-board aircraft. This information will
    allow CEPT to perform an impact analysis of the deployment of such systems on
    board of aircrafts. The results of this analysis will be used by CEPT when looking
    at a possible new allocation for the use of RLAN onboard Aircraft in ECC Recommendation
    70-03.\r\n"
