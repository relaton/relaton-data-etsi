abstract:
- content: "This TBR specifies those technical requirements under\r\nArticles 4.1
    to 4.5 of Council Directive 93/97/EEC that\r\napply to satellite earth station
    equipment that is capable\r\nof operation in one or more of the following frequency
    ranges:\r\n - 1 525,0 to 1 544,0 MHz  and  1 555,0 to 1 559,0 MHz (Space to Earth)\r\n-
    1 626,5 to 1 645,5 MHz  and  1 656,5 to 1 660,5 MHz (Earth to Space)\r\n of the
    Mobile Satellite Service (MSS).\r\nThese requirements are taken from ETS 300 254.\r\n
    This TBR does not contain the essential requirements under Article 4.6\r\nfor
    interworking via the public telecommunications network in\r\njustified cases,
    and does not provide any guarantee of correct\r\ninterworking between satellite
    earth station equipment.\r\n This TBR specifies the requirements for satellite
    earth station\r\nequipment that\r\n - is capable of being used either for transmission
    only, or for\r\ntransmission and reception (transmit-receive), or for reception
    only\r\n(receive-only), of radio-communication signals in any of the bands\r\nspecified
    above;\r\n - is not purpose built satellite earth sation equipment intended for\r\nuse
    as part of the public telecommunications network.\r\n This TBR applies to all
    satellite equipment as described above,\r\nirrespective of whether the satellite
    earth station equipment provides\r\nadditional interfaces, telecommunications
    services or functions.\r\nHowever additional TBRs may also apply.\r\n"
