abstract:
- content: "There are different groups of prospective users of quantum key distribution
    (QKD) systems, having different security requirements and other functional requirements
    on these systems. \r\nSecurity requirements (for example regarding cryptographic
    strength or specific audit capabilities) are in most cases imposed by organisational
    security policies reflecting specific security needs of a user group. Additional
    functional requirements are related to system availability and interconnectivity
    constraints, or to system management compatibility. In this work item a catalogue
    of security and other functional requirements shall be compiled that lists security
    and other functional requirements for different user groups and different fields
    of application. The catalogue shall serve as a basis for implementation independent
    specifications of QKD systems."
