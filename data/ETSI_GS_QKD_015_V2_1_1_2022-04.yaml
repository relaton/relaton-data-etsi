  content: This work item will make minor revisions to GS QKD 015 to fix errors and
    align with work under development. The deliverable defines management interfaces
    to integrate QKD with disaggregated network control plane architectures, in particular
    with Software Defined Networks (SDN). It defines abstraction models and workflows
    between a SDN-enabled QKD node and the SDN Controller. This includes resource
    discovery, capabilities dissemination and system configuration operations.  Application
    layer interfaces and quantum-channel interfaces are out of scope. The new version
    includes minor modifications to clarify the parts that serve as a basis for the
    DGS/QKD-018_OrchIntSDN Orchestration Interface for Software Defined Networks.
