abstract:
- content: "No mandatory protocol between the Cell Broadcast Centre (CBC) and the\r\nBase\r\nStation
    Controller (BSC) is specified by GSM; this is a matter of\r\nagreement\r\nbetween
    CBC and PLMN operators.\r\n This report specifies three alternative approaches
    to the\r\nspecification of\r\nprotocol stacks of communication protocols for the
    purpose of\r\nfulfilling the\r\nservice requirements of the primitives specified
    for the CBC - BSC\r\ninterface\r\nin GSM 03.41.\r\n One approach is based upon
    the use of the complete OSI reference model\r\n(see\r\nX.200), another approach
    is based upon the use of only the lower 3 OSI\r\nlayers,\r\nand another approach
    is based upon the use of CCITT Signalling System\r\nNo. 7\r\n(see Q.700).\r\n
    Specifications are based upon individual contributions. Any judgement\r\nconcerning
    functionality, completeness and advantages/disadvantages of\r\nimplementation
    is intentionally omitted.\r\n This will be an update of ETR 107 (i.e. Edition
    2)\r\n"
