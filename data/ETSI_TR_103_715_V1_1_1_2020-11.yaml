abstract:
- content: "This work will identify, define and analyse relevant approaches with respect
    to the use cases and requirements developed in DTR/SmartM2M-123150. The most appropriate
    one will be selected.\r\nThe need to plug in the solution on the oneM2M standard
    will drive the solution analysis, to determine the best approach to be followed.
    The activity will also look to the query and discovery mechanisms already available,
    starting from the ones defined by ETSI (e.g. the one included in NGSI-LD) to extract
    (and potentially adapt) the applicable components and to ensure a smooth interworking
    with non-oneM2M solutions."
