abstract:
- content: "REASON:\r\nAmendment 1 to ETS 300 500 due to a potential contradiction
    between\r\nGSM 02.01 and GSM 02.03 related to the negotiation from TS61 to TS62.\r\nCurrnetly,
    if a TS61 call setup cannot be supported then it shall be\r\nnegotiated to TS62.
    However, before this can be done a subscription\r\ncheck must be completed which,
    according to GSM 02.01, will fail.\r\nCONSEQUNCES OF NON-ACCEPTANCE:\r\nIf this
    change is not accepted, then a subscription check for TS61\r\nwill cause the call
    to fail despite the fact that the call has a good\r\nchance of being sucessfully
    completed.\r\n "
