abstract:
- content: 'The result of the European Commission Study Group on Smart Appliances
    ontologies will take into account all the interest of the relevant stakeholders.
    This work will develop the mapping to oneM2M. Therefore this work has two major
    objectives: 1) To provide a standardize framework for the Common Ontology derived
    from the EC Study Group on Smart Appliances 2) To map the common ontology onto
    the elementary oneM2M standardized resources and services.'
