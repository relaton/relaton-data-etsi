abstract:
- content: "ANF-CIDL is an additional network feature which allows the assignment
    of a Global Call Identification (GID) to identify a call end-to-end over the call
    route (i.e. between the two end PINXs). As an option, a Thread Identification
    may be assigned to different calls which are logically linked together due to
    the operation of other supplementary services and/or ANFs. Additionally a Leg
    Identification may be assigned, to identify the different legs of a call.\r\nThis
    ANF has been developed to support the use of CSTA (ECMA-269) in a networked environment,
    i.e. in a PISN. Use of this ANF for other applications is not precluded."
