- content: "1. To improve the resilience to blocking for devices for uses which have
    the greatest risk of suffering interference from future deployments e.g. LTE in
    the adjacent bands. \r\n2. To consider further the definitions of categorisation
    of receivers in order to support item 1 without adding unnecessary requirements
    to all devices.\r\n3. To improve the test methods or to include alternative test
    methods as appropriate.\r\n4. To review the measurement uncertainties."
