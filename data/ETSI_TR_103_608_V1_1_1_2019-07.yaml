  content: To specify, in collaboration with the ETSI IT department, the publication
    framework for the SAREF ontology and its extensions. The publication framework
    provides a uniform documentation website for SAREF and its extensions such that
    (1) the documentation is designed for domain experts and software developers instead
    of ontology engineers, (2) industries can like or share the content, provide useful
    feedback to SAREF developers and suggest additions/modifications. Additionally,
    SAREF developers would get to know more about the SAREF community of users. The
    publication framework will enable industries to implement solutions with SAREF
    faster. It will reinforce the engagement of the community of users such that the
    SAREF developers can plan new evolution of the current and future extensions.
