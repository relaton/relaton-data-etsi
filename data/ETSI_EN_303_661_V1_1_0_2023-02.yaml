abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies technical characteristics and methods of
    measurements for GBSAR and HD-GBSAR devices. This radio equipment types are capable
    of operating in the frequency range 17,1 to 17,3 GHz (GBSAR) and 76-77 GHZ (HD-GBSAR).
    The work includes a detailed description of the wanted performance criterion,
    RX-requirements and fixed limits for all requirements based on a clear test procedure
    for GBSAR and HD-GBSAR devices. The work item shall issue a new standard to accommodate
    GBSAR from EN 300 440 and defining the specific receiver performance criterion
    for all type of GBSAR equipment. Equipment covered by the present document operates
    in accordance with ERC REC 70-03 Annex 6, band l (GBSAR) and with ECC/DEC/(21)02
    for HD-GBSAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
