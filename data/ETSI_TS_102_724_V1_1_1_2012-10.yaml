abstract:
- content: "The specifications for operation in the 5 GHz range to satisfy the harmonised
    usage of the designated spectrum by control and service channels including usage
    of channels for road- safety related ITS applications. \r\nThis will also include
    transmit and receive restrictions (likely to have implications on TPC). \r\nReference
    usage scenarios and parameters will be depicted in informative annexes that justify
    the specifications.\r\nCo-channel and adjacent channel interference considerations
    will be encompassed. \r\n"
