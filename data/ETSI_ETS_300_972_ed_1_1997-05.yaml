  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) gives a description of\r\nthe
    general baseband operation of half rate speech traffic channels in\r\nthe transmitter
    and in the receiver of GSM Mobile Stations (MS)s and\r\nBase Station Systems (BSS)s
    during Discontinuous Transmission (DTX).\r\nFor clarity, the description is structured
    according to the block diag\r\nrams in figures 1 and 4. Except in the case described
    below, this stru\r\ncture of distributing the various functions between system
    entities is\r\nnot mandatory for implementation, as long as the operation on the
    air\r\ninterface and on the speech decoder output remains the same.\r\nIn the
    case of BSSs where the speech transcoder is located remotely in\r\nthe Base Station
    Controller (BSC), the implementation of the interfac\r\nes between the DTX Handlers
    and the Radio Sub System (RSS) as describe\r\nd in this ETS together with all
    their flags is mandatory, being a part\r\nof the A-bis interface as described
    in GSM 08.61 (ETS 300 979) [10].\r\nThe DTX functions described in this ETS are
    mandatory for implementati\r\non in all GSM MSs. The receiver requirements are
    mandatory for impleme\r\nntation in all GSM BSSs, the transmitter requirements
    only for those w\r\nhere downlink DTX will be used.\r\n"
