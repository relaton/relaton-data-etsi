  content: To produce a Harmonised Standard, taking into account the ongoing ECC Report
    200 and ECC Report 189, to support Network Based SRDs within the 870 -876 MHz
    frequency range, such as Metropolitan Machine Mesh (M3M e.g. TR 103 055) and Smart
    Metering/Smart Grid (e.g. TR 102 886) - TS 102 887 could also of relevance. It
    is noted that these SRD equipment will be class 2 to ensure the best spectrum
    efficiency whilst protecting the primary service operating in some countries.
