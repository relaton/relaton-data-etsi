abstract:
- content: "The IBCF requirements are distributed in several basic specifications
    and therefore in several test specifications. Hence in a test lab with a test
    service explicitly to test conformance of the IBCF functionality it is useful
    to set on a single test specification instead of a conglomerate of documents.
    \r\n- This document shall contain the Test suite structure and test purposes.\r\n"
