  content: 'This Technical Report will  provide assessment of the feasibility of implementing
    any new and existing mitigation techniques (i.e. already use in the band in other
    applications) to enable coexistence between Wireless access systems including
    radio local area networks (WAS/RLAN) and RTTT/smart tachograph, radars (including
    Fast Frequency Hopping) operating in the band 5 725 MHz to 5 850 MHz, in support
    of the work within CEPT. Relevant deliverables from CEPT sharing and compatibility
    studies and from ETSI shall be taken into account in this work. '
