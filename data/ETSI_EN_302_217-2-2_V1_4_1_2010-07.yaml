  content: "Include unified spectrum masks for classes 2 and 4L for all channel separations
    (1,75/3,5/7/14/28/56 MHz). Together with the already unified ones for classes
    4H, 5A, 5B and 6A they would be moved in the main body of the EN.\r\nOther older
    masks, after consideration for their possible complete removal, will remain in
    the annexes only as special cases.\r\nExtend class 6 systems to 7 and 14 MHz channels.\r\nIntroduce
    system parameters for the 42 GHz newly made available for P-P operations."
