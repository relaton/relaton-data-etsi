abstract:
- content: "Full revision of the document which will include updated control and monitoring
    architecture and application examples. This document will align with the updated
    part 1 of the series.\r\n\r\nThe different site cases will be extended by an example
    including a master DGU (Data Gathering Unit) as an entry point which is responsible
    for the control and monitoring of power units, cooling systems, and building controls
    via their NG-CU/NG-DGU.\r\nAlso accuracy of measurement could be revised considering
    existing standard."
