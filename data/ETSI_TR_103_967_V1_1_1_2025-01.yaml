  content: This work item will give an overview of the impact of quantum computing
    on symmetric algorithms such as block ciphers and hash functions.  It will discuss
    the practicality of parallelising Grovers algorithm, the effect of limiting quantum
    circuit depth, and the overhead from quantum error correction.  It supplements
    ETSI GR QSC 006 (Limits to quantum computing applied to symmetric keys sizes)
    by summarising current quantum resource estimates for attacks against widely used
    symmetric algorithms with reasonable circuit depth assumptions.  It will also
    provide guidance on the need to increase symmetric key lengths for a range of
    different use cases.
