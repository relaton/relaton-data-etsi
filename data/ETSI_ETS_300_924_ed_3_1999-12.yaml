abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) specifies the stage 1 d\r\nescription
    of the enhanced Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-emption Serv\r\nice (eMLPP). This
    service has two parts: precedence and pre-emption. P\r\nrecedence involves assigning
    a priority level to a call in combination\r\nwith fast call set-up. Pre-emption
    involves the seizing of resources,\r\nwhich are in use by a call of a lower precedence,
    by a higher level p\r\nrecedence call in the absence of idle resources. Pre-emption
    can also\r\ninvolve the disconnection of an on-going call of lower precedence
    to a\r\nccept an incoming call of higher precedence.\r\nThe eMLPP service is provided
    as a network operator s option to a doma\r\nin of a network. The domain can be
    the whole network or a subset of th\r\ne network. The eMLPP service applies to
    all network resources in the d\r\nomain that is in common use. The eMLPP service
    is applicable to all mo\r\nbile stations in the domain with all or some mobile
    stations having a\r\nrespective subscription assigning precedence according to
    the eMLPP se\r\nrvice.\r\neMLPP is a supplementary service and shall be provided
    to a subscriber\r\nfor all basic services subscribed to and for which eMLPP applies.\r\nNOTE:\tIt
    is under study whether normal GSM phase 2 mobile stations wil\r\nl be able to
    be used for this service.\r\nThe service is described from the service subscriber
    s and user s poin\r\nt of view, in particular:\r\n-\tthe procedure for normal
    operation with successful outcome;\r\n -\tthe action to be taken in exceptional
    circumstances;\r\n -\tthe interaction with other GSM services and features.\r\n
    This ETS does not deal with the Man-Machine Interface (MMI) requiremen\r\nts,
    but makes reference to the appropriate Global System for Mobile co\r\nmmunications
    (GSM) specifications.\r\nThis ETS is applicable to telese vices 1x and 6x and
    to all bearer ser\r\nvices used in a mobile network according to the digital cellular
    telec\r\nommunications system GSM if eMLPP is provided. Any interaction with ot\r\nher
    services and/or networks not dealt with in sections 8 or 9 are out\r\nside the
    scope of this ETS.\r\n  "
