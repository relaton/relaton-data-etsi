abstract:
- content: This work item focuses on identifying the necessary support provided by
    Multi-access Edge Computing for network slicing and, in addition, how the orchestration
    of resources and services from multiple administrative domains could facilitate
    that. The work will be a study with the intent to collect and analyse the use
    cases relating to the deployment of MEC functions in combination with network
    slicing based on the findings from external SDOs, industry collaborations and
    regional projects (e.g., ETSI NFV, 3GPP, NGMN, 5G-Transformer, 5G-Coral), evaluate
    the gaps from the defined MEC features and functions, and identify the new requirements.
    When necessary, this may include identifying new  MEC services or interfaces,
    as well as changes to existing  MEC services or interfaces, data models, application
    rules and application requirements. The work item will recommend the necessary
    normative work to close these gaps.
