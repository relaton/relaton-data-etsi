  content: This work item aims to summarize and analyze existing and potential mitigation
    against threats for AI-based systems. The goal is to have guidelines for mitigating
    against threats introduced by adopting AI into systems. These guidelines will
    shed light baselines of securing AI-based systems by mitigating against known
    or potential security threats. They also address security capabilities, challenges,
    and limitations when adopting mitigation for AI-based systems in certain potential
    use cases.
