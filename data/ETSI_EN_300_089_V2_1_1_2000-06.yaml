abstract:
- content: "Update resulting from work on number screening.\r\nTo define enhancements
    of the existing CLI supplementary services in the ISDN and PSTN in order to limit
    the number of situations that calls will be rejected due to Anonymous Call Rejection
    (ACR) reasons. The purpose of these enhancements are to specify those network
    facilities that can be used to offer a solution for specific situations (e.g.
    calls originating from call centres and traffic being diverted due to least cost
    routing scenarios) where a number can not be presented in spite of the fact that
    the caller is willing to identify himself/herself. These enhancements should not
    interfere with the authentication function of the CLI supplementary services.\r\n\r\nReference
    document: ETSs 30089 Ed.1 and 300 090 Ed.1."
