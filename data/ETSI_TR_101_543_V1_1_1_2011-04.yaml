abstract:
- content: The purpose of the tests is to evaluate the characteristics and performance
    of RFID equipment operating at their three principal frequencies of use. The information
    to be derived from the tests is directly relevant to the work of STF 396 in preparing
    their response to EC Mandate M/436. Additionally it will provide a number of the
    experts in the STF with the opportunity to witness at first hand the operation
    of RFID in a number of defined scenarios.
