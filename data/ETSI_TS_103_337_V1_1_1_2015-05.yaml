abstract:
- content: "In a global alert network, satellite links provide robust communication
    channels with broadcast capabilities.\r\nAlert messages can be issued from/distributed
    to many technologies including and not restricted to: SMS and cell broadcast,
    audio message, facsimile, POCSAG (pagers), slow scan TV, telex, etc. \r\nBy using
    a standard and generic encapsulation format, one is therefore able to guarantee
    interoperability.\r\nThis work item aims at defining a flexible encapsulation
    scheme for these alert messages still making provision for adding new message
    formats, and defining mechanisms in order to fulfil the associated requirements
    (e.g. as identified in former EMTEL TR 102-182)."
