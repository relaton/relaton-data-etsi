abstract:
- content: "This work item to amend the former version of EN 302 729 V2.1.1 is targeted
    to address the request of the EU desk officer. This includes a detailed description
    of the wanted performance criterion, RX-requirements and fixed limits for all
    requirements based on a clear test procedure for LPR sensors in strictly vertical
    downward installations.\r\nA first collection of open points which shall be considered
    (in addition) are uploaded as: ERMTGUWB(17)040004\r\nThe necessary classification
    between the different use-cases/wanted performance criterions/receiver requirements
    will be based on measurement distances of the LPR sensor. The systems operating
    based on regulation (and amendments): EC Decision 2013/752/EU and ECC Decision
    (11)02 \r\n"
