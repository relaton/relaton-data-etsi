  content: "Technical requirements to be provided by terminal equipment of the\r\nTFTS
    capable of, and intended for, connection to a public\r\ntelecommunication network.
    TFTS will operate in the frequency\r\nband 1670-1675 MHz (ground to air) and 1800-1805
    MHz\r\n(air to ground). The modulation technique is /4 DQPSK.\r\nThe system is
    cellular in nature and the availablespectrum will\r\nsupport up to 164 radio channelswhich
    may be reused between cells.\r\nEach radio channel will support four voice telephone
    circuits\r\noperating with a 9,6 kbit/s voice coding alogorithm.\r\nThe objective
    of this TBR is to define the minimum requirements  for\r\nconformance testing
    of TFTS Aircraft Station (AS). This shall include\r\ntesting of the radio interface
    in terms of RF parameters and basic\r\ninterworking tests. The interworking tests
    include a set of tests over\r\nthe CTU/AT interface which conform to ARINC 746
    Attachment 11\r\ncharacteristics. For non-ARINC 746 aircraft the TBR includes\r\ninterworking
    tests based on the AT plus the terminal equipment\r\nconfiguration.\r\nThis TBR
    covers the essential requirements of the TTE Directive\r\n91/263/EEC Articles
    4c, 4d, 4e and 4f.\r\nArticles 4a and 4b are subject to proof of conformity outside
    of the\r\nscope of this TBR and, therefore, are not covered by this TBR.\r\nTelephony
    for TFTS is not a justified case and therfore, there are no\r\nrequirements on
    voice quality in relation to Article 4g of the TTE\r\nDirective.\r\nCertain aspects
    of EMC performance are the subject of normal aircraft\r\neqipment certification
    and are specified in Eurocae ED14C\r\n(RTCA-DO160C). The applicable test categories
    are specified in ARINC\r\nCharacteristics 752.\r\nIt should be recognized that
    TFTS mobile stations are airborne\r\nequipment and that they are also subject
    \ to a separate certification\r\nprocess for aircraft.\r\n (DI/RES-05-01/4 (I-ETS
    300  ...) constitutes the full conformance\r\ntests for TFTS. The set of requirements
    in I-ETS 300  and this TBR\r\nare not necessarily identical.\r\n"
