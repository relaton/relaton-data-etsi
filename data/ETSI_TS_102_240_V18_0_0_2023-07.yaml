abstract:
- content: "When the physical interface is not accessible to an attached test tool,
    alternative methods for the verification of conformance requirements based on
    APDU communication on the UICC-terminal interface are needed. The LS C6-220198/SETREQ(22)000011
    from 3GPP WG CT6 is proposing  a new verification method based on toolkit test
    events- as one of the recommended test methods.\r\nThe scope of this Work Item
    is as below.\r\n- Define requirements for Toolkit test events \r\n- Define Requirements
    for the CAT runtime environment to register and deregister applets for the toolkit
    test events.\r\n- Define Requirements for the CAT runtime environment to trigger
    the toolkit test events.\r\n- Define security requirements to restrict the usage
    of the toolkit test events to tests purposes only.\r\n"
