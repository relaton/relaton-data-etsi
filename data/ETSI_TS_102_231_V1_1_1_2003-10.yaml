abstract:
- content: "The scope of this task is to provide the set of specifications, which
    will allow interoperable provision of TSP (CA) status information to relying parties,
    who need to validate the trustworthiness of the service which certified the signer
    of a contract, transaction, etc.\r\nThe standard needs the support of the different
    national schemes who run and supervise the certification schemes. These actors
    are currently not represented in the ETSI ESI WG area and thus, needs special
    arrangement to become involved in the standard development, promotion and implementation
    process. A workshop is proposed to this end to be arranged early spring 2002."
