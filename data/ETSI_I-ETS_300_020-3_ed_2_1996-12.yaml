abstract:
- content: "These are the technical characteristics and methods of measurement for\r\nmobile
    stations, for the Pan European Personal CommunicationDigital M\r\nobile Radio
    System standardized by the ETSI Technical Committee \"Speci\r\nal Mobile Group\"
    (SMG).\r\nIn these specifications, a GSM(DCS 1 800) Mobile Station can be:\r\n-\ta
    vehicle mounted station;\r\n-\ta transportable station;\r\n-\ta handheld station;\r\n-\ta
    vehicle mounted/transportable station;\r\n-\ta vehicle mounted/handheld station.\r\n
    These specifications cover the minimum characteristics considered nece\r\nssary
    in order to provide sufficient equipment performance for mobile\r\nstation equipment
    in the GSMDCS 1 800 system and to prevent interferen\r\nce to other services or
    to other users, and to GSM and DCS 1 800 PLMNs\r\n. Where the 900 MHz service
    is referred to in sections of GSM 11.10 no\r\nt included in this document then
    this shall be considered as the 1 800\r\nMHz service.\r\nThey do not necessarily
    include all the characteristics which may be r\r\nequired by a user, nor do they
    necessarily represent the optimum perfo\r\nrmance achievable.\r\nThey apply to
    the public land mobile radio telephone service in the GS\r\nMDCS 1 800 system,
    using constant envelope modulation and operating on\r\nradio frequencies in the
    9001 800 MHz band with a channel separation\r\nof 200 kHz and carrying 8 full
    rate traffic channels or 16 half rate c\r\nhannels per carrier according to the
    TDMA principle.\r\n "
