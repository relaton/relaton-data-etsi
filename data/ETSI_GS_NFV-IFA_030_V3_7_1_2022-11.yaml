  content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 030 conducts NFV Release 3 maintenance. It corrects
    errors, ambiguities, misalignments, and applies editorial modifications (i.e.
    Corrections of category F and D as described in ETSI TWPs Annex L). This edition
    does not add or modify features, nor does it extend the scope of the former Release
    3 edition summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nNFV-IFA 030 specifies the functional requirements,
    interfaces and operations to support the provision of network services across
    multiple administrative domains based on the interactions between NFVOs in different
    administrative domains (supported over the Or-Or reference point). NFV-IFA 030
    also specifies the information elements exchanged over the specified interfaces.
    The different aspects specified in NFV-IFA 030 are derived from ETSI GR NFV-IFA
    028."
