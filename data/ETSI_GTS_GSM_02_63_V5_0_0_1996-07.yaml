  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) specifies stage one of\r\nthe
    Packet Data on Signalling channels service (PDS) which allows\r\npacket data transmission
    in GSM networks on dedicated channels.\r\nThe PDS service is offered in two variants,
    PDSS1 and PDSS2; each\r\nvariant may be supported by a mobile station independently.
    PDSS1 is\r\nsubject to subscription in a GSM network, whereas PDSS2 may only be\r\nsubject
    to subscription of an application (this however is out of the\r\nscope of the
    service description).\r\nThe service is described from the service subscriber
    s and user s\r\npoint of view: in particular:\r\n- the procedure for normal operation
    with successful outcome;\r\n - the action to be taken in exceptional circumstances;\r\n
    - the interaction with other GSM services and features.\r\n This specification
    does not deal with the Man-Machine Interface (MMI)\r\nrequirements.\r\n"
