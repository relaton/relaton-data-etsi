abstract:
- content: "This work item provides a framework to configure oneM2M AEs and CSEs in
    the Field Domain by the oneM2M SP. \r\nThe configuration information may include:\r\n·The
    availability of protocol bindings\r\n·The URI of registrar CSE that  receives
    Registration requests.\r\n·The URI of registrar CSE that receives non-Registration
    requests.\r\n·The address of target resource to use a oneM2M Service. [e.g. reconfigurable
    to add/delete service during operation]\r\n·The credential data that is required
    for accessing the resource. [e.g. reconfigurable to grant/revoke authorization]\r\nAs
    the result of consideration in stage 2 work, it is needed to develop a Technical
    Specification to solve existing problem in Release-1 specifications which only
    supports pre-provitioning for configuring the filed-domain devices. \r\nThe security
    aspects for remote provisioning should be discussed in WG4.\r\n"
