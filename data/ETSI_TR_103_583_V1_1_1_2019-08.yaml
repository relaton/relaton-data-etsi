  content: "1) To provide information on the intended applications of multiple gigabit
    wireless systems (MGWS) in radio spectrum between 57GHz and 71GHz including outdoor
    applications; 2) To detail Millimetre Wave communication for Intelligent Transport
    Systems (mmW-ITS) and propose moving the existing mmW-ITS allocation to a single
    MGWS channel; 3) To include technical parameters, mitigation techniques, the relation
    to the existing spectrum regulation, additional new radio spectrum requirements
    and expected compatibility issues; 4) This document is intended to update and
    replace TR 102 555 and TR 102 400.\r\n"
