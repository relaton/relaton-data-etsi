abstract:
- content: "The document will specify mechanisms and protocols for secure and privacy-preserving
    communication in vehicular environments, including vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to
    infrastructure communication. It will provide credential and identity management,
    privacy \r\nand anonymity, integrity protection, authentication and authorization.
    It will incorporate mechanisms such as addressing schemes building on pseudonymization
    concepts, the protocols for address update, and for exchanging, updating, and
    invalidating credentials to \r\ncounterfeit attacks on security and reliability
    of communication. Further methods to prevent malicious tracking of identity and
    location will be provided."
