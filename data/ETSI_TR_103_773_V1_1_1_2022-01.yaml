  content: TR 100 027 written in the early days of ETSI, provides a set of methods
    of measurement for private mobile radio equipment to be used as draft material
    in ETSI standards written at a later stage. The original intention was to keep
    it up to date but that work was never done. Later on other documents addressing
    methods of measurements were developed (ETSI TR 102 273-x, ETSI TS 103 052). Some
    ERM WGs have in addition developed their own documents (e.g. EN 300 220-1 in TG28,
    EN 303 883 in TGUWB, EN 303 396 in TGSRR). In order to reduce the risk that radio
    standards in ETSI will diverge in too many directions, it is hereby proposed to
    analyze the ways in which a set of reference documents (e.g. several TSs) could
    be written including text for methods of measurement to be used as reference material
    in future ETSI standards. The TR should analyse if there is a clear benefit of
    developing and maintaining such reference documents, for which areas reference
    documents should be developed at a central place in ETSI (e.g. at WGRM), for which
    areas the expert WG should be responsible, and if there would be other options
    (e.g. refer to existing documents from other organisations.). Pros and cons of
    different options should be analysed. Such reference documents would provide a
    clear guidance on common information and methods in harmonised standards and it
    would be a huge help for rapporteurs of new harmonised standards. The aim of this
    Work item is to describe the various possibilities and find out their different
    merits.
