  content: This work item will study aspects about enabling in the NFV framework new
    dimensions to extend and evolve the NFVI, in terms of reachability, location,
    and mobility, resources distribution, and resources heterogeneity. New locations
    for infrastructure resources (e.g., data centers for non-terrestial networks),
    new types of infrastructure resource (e.g., SmartNICs, metasurfaces) and new sources
    of infrastucture resources (e.g., Cloud hyper-scalers) adding more heterogeneity
    and that are becoming prominent for the development of future telecom networks
    will be considered. The work item will identify relevant use cases and will also
    delineate a set of possible design options and potential solutions. It will also
    investigate the impact on the NFV framework and the relevant interfaces, providing
    a set of recommendations.
