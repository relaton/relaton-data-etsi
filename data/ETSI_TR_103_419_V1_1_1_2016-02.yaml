abstract:
- content: 'Energy Aware Networking adapt performances and power consumption according
    to traffic load. Actual energy efficiency measurement procedures are unsuitable
    to determines the equipmentâ€™s ability to adapt performances and power consumption
    to traffic load needs, hence a novel measurement method is required. This WI will
    focus on fixed access and transport nodes. '
