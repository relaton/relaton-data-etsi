  content: 'Energy Aware Networking adapt performances and power consumption according
    to traffic load. Actual energy efficiency measurement procedures are unsuitable
    to determines the equipments ability to adapt performances and power consumption
    to traffic load needs, hence a novel measurement method is required. This WI will
    focus on fixed access and transport nodes. '
