abstract:
- content: "Technical Report (TR) will focus on the characteristics, benefits and
    limitations of processor power management features in deployment situations, taking
    into account the work done in TGG.\r\n\r\nServer power management features will
    also be available for system fans, memory, storage, Graphic Processing Units and
    I/O components. Their combined implementation introduces greater complexity and
    requires a higher level of integration with the serverâ€™s platform firmware and
    operating system. The component power management is beyond the scope of this report.\r\n\r\nThis
    TR will provide a brief overview of CPU P-states and C-states, test data detailing
    the power demand reductions achieved by different power management implementations,
    the measured active state energy efficiency improvements, and the performance
    and exit latency impacts of server power management features. \r\n\r\nThe TR only
    addresses the current state of these technologies"
