  content: "Analysis of applicability of detachable antenna to directivity classes
    2-3-4 in high mmW bands (W and D band)\r\nIntegrated antenna technology capabilites
    regarding non-detachable passive and active antennas regarding both PtP and PtMP
    starting from D band\r\nOn air test methods (i.e. radiated power ones) that are
    not described in current version of ETSI TM4 standards for PtP and PtMP with detachable
    antenna\r\nInterference and planning matters related to the new duplex methods,
    i.e. Full Duplex (FD) and fFDD (flexible Frequency Division Duplex), allowed in
    D-Band according to ECC Rec.(18)01"
