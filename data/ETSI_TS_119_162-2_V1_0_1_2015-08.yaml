  content: Specific communities or use cases may have additional requirements that
    are not addressed by the baseline profile defined in ASiC that can be built using
    the building blocks defined there or additional ones. The present document references
    such specific extended use of ASiC and aims to be used for containers that collects
    together electronic documents including those supported by OCF, ODF and UCF describing
    how these container formats can be used to associate digital signatures with any
    data objects in the container. In particular, the present documents aim is to
    work with implementations of OCF (OEBPS Container Format), ODF (Open Office),
    UCF or any similarly structured container format. It is also the aim of the present
    document to address use of "virtual dossiers" container formats such as required
    in some pan-European projects.
