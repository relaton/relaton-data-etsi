  content: "This Interim European Telecommunication Standard (I-ETS) specifies\r\nrequirements
    of fusion splices to be used in single-mode optical fibre\r\ntelecommunications
    land based (not submarine) systems. The scope\r\nincludes the establishment of
    minimum unform requirements for the\r\nfollowing aspects:\r\n \t- optical, environmental
    and mechanical properties;\r\n\t- test conditions,\r\n\t- acceptance criteria.\r\nSome
    users may have additional specific requirements, such as a need\r\nto verify perfprmance
    at lower temperatures. These users should\r\nspecify slices conforming to the
    basic ETSI performance standard,\r\nplus additional tests or more severe test
    conditions.\r\n For the purpose of qualification, a splice is defined as \"fusion\r\nspliced
    fibres protected by a slice protector with fibre tails of\r\n1,5 m on each side
    of the splice protector.\" A minimum length of 1,5 m\r\non each side of the splice
    protector must be exposed to the test\r\nconditions of all climatic and environmental
    tests.\r\n "
