abstract:
- content: The deliverable will specify a network protocol for ad hoc routing in vehicular
    environments, including vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure wireless
    communication. The protocol will support communication based on concepts for geographical
    addressing and forwarding (Geocast). It provides mechanisms for periodic messaging
    and multi-hop, robust, efficient, reliable, secure and anonymous communication.
