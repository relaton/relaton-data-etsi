  content: "This Work Item will produce a document to specify a framework for use
    within ETSI ENI ISG to coordinate and promote public demonstrations of Proof of
    Concept (PoC) validating key technical components developed in ENI. The objective
    of the PoCs is to build commercial awareness and confidence and encourage development
    of an open ecosystem by integrating components from different players.  This framework
    outlines: \r\n rationale for ENI ISG PoCs; \r\n ENI ISG PoC process (submission
    and format of PoC Proposals, review and acceptance criteria of PoC proposals,
    and ENI ISG PoC Report format and requirements); \r\n ETSI support for PoC teams."
