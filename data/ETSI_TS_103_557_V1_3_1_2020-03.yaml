abstract:
- content: "This work specifies methodologies for simulating reverberation conditions,
    including speech signals, characteristic transfer functions and geometric relations
    of talkers and devices, as well as the control of room acoustic parameters. Such
    methodologies are to be used for the measurement of communication devices.\r\nThis
    revision is to add additional impulse responses to the database and clearly defining
    DUT positioning within reproduction environment."
