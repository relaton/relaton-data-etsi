  content: 'The work item will specify capabilities to support the combination of
    closed-loop automation with intents originating from ZSM consumers (via northbound
    interface), focusing on intent-driven governance and coordination of closed loops.
    The scope of this work includes use cases, additional requirements related to
    intent-driven aspects of ZSM009-1, as well as procedures and information models.
    This work item will create a normative specification covering stages 1 and 2.
    It will also identify and describe additions to ETSI ZSM002 v1.1.1 and ETSI ZSM009-1
    v1.1.1 topics related to the handling of intent and non-intent interactions will
    be considered as needed. Related work in ETSI, other SDOs and open-source projects
    will be considered and used where applicable. '
