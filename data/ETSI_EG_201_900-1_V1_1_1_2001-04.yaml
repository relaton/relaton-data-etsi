  content: This document specifies the procedural and protocol requirements to support
    the efficient delivery of PSTN and ISDN services across an ATM based access section
    between two Interworking Functions located at the customer premises and within
    the network, respectively. The specification will be based on the ATM Forum specification
    STR-VMOA-LES-01.00 (Voice and Multimedia over ATM - Loop Emulation Service using
    AAL2), with appropriate selection or restriction of options and, if necessary,
    modifications and amendments.
