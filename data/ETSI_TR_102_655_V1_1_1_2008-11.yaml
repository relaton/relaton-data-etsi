abstract:
- content: Develop a Systems Reference Document (SRDoc) for future requirements for  High
    Capacity, Low Power Active Medical Implant (LP-AMI) and peripherals (LP-AMI-P)
    medical wireless telemetry and telecontrol systems operating in sub bands which  frequencies
    are within the range 2 360 MHz to 3 400 MHz and with various bandwidths applicable
    to each sub band to cover the rapidly increasing market demand for medical monitoring
    applications and need for ultra high speed transmission rates due to increasing
    industry needs.
