abstract:
- content: "To prepare a short and simple set of objectives and principles for the
    telephony performance of networks that primarily use their own transmission infrastructure
    and that use digital exchanges and digital connections between exchanges.  The
    objectives and principles should take account of the liberalisation of telephony
    services and the interconnection of several separate networks, each with different
    topologies, in the provision of telephony connections.\r\n"
