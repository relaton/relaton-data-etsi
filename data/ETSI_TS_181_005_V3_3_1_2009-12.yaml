  content: This document defines the overall requirements for the TISPAN NGN from
    the perspective of users, service providers' (operators) and content providers
    for the support of NGN services. The objective is not to standardise NGN applications
    but, instead, to identify the requirements to enable their support. The deliverable
    will expand requirements in the R3 definition and reference other TISPAN NGN Work
    Items where the detailed services and requirements are specified.
