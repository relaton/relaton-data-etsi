  content: "This GTS contains a detailed\r\ndescription of the handover procedures
    to be used in GSM PLMNs.  The\r\npurpose of the handover procedures, as described
    in this\r\nspecification,  are to ensure that the connection to the MS is\r\nmaintained
    as it moves from one BSS area to another.\r\nThis specification considers the
    following two cases:\r\ni) Handover between Base Stations connected to the same
    MSC,  this is\r\ntermed an Intra-MSC handover.\r\n ii) Handover between Base Stations
    connected to different MSCs, this\r\nis termed an Inter-MSC handover.  This category
    can be sub-divided\r\ninto three further procedures:\r\n a) the Basic Inter-MSC
    Handover procedure, where the MS is handed over\r\nfrom a controlling MSC (MSC-A)
    to another MSC (MSC-B);\r\n b) the Subsequent Inter-MSC Handover procedure, where
    the MS is handed\r\nover from MSC-B to a third MSC (MSC-B );\r\n c) the Subsequent
    Inter-MSC handback, where the MS is handed back from\r\nMSC-B to MSC-A.\r\n In
    both cases i) and ii) the same procedures as defined in the TS GSM\r\n08.08 and
    the TS GSM 04.08 shall be used on the A-interface and on the\r\nRadio Interface,
    respectively.  In case ii) the handover procedures\r\nshall transport the A-interface
    messages between MSC-A and MSC-B\r\ndescribed in the Mobile Application Part (MAP),
    Technical\r\nSpecification GSM 09.02.  The split in functionality between the
    BSS\r\nand MSC is described in the GSM 08 series of Technical Specifications.\r\nThe
    interworking between the GSM 09.02 protocol and the GSM 08.08\r\nprotocol is described
    in the GSM 09.10 Technical Specification.\r\nHandovers which take place on the
    same MSC are termed Intra-MSC\r\nhandovers; this includes both Inter-BSS and Intra-BSS
    handovers.\r\nThis technical specification also covers the requirements for directed\r\nretry
    and the handover without a circuit conneMtion between MSC-A and\r\nMSC-B.  This
    technical specification does not consider the case of\r\nhandovers between radio
    channels on the same BSS (Intra-BSS handover)\r\nor the handover of packet radio
    services.\r\nInter-MSC hand-over  imposes a few limitations  on the system. After\r\ninter-MSC
    hand-over:\r\n- call re-establishment is not supported.\r\nThe list of GSM 08.08
    features supported during and after Inter-MSC\r\nhandover is given in TS GSM 09.08.\r\nIn
    the Inter-MSC handover case, the interworking between a Phase 1\r\nBSSMAP protocol
    possibly used by one MSC and the Phase 2 BSSMAP\r\nprotocol used in the Phase
    2 MAP protocol on the E-interface is\r\nperformed by this MSC.\r\nNOTE: The message
    primitive names used in the SDL diagrams and message\r\nflows in this technical
    specification do not represent the actual\r\nmessages specified in the GSM 04
    and GSM 08 series or the services\r\nspecified in the GSM 09 series of technical
    specifications.  The\r\nprimitive names are only intended to be indicative of
    their use in\r\nthis document.\r\n  "
