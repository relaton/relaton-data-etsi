  content: "The present document specifies the technical requirements and methods
    of measurement for Short Range Devices (SRD) working as broadband devices with
    at least 500 MHz occupied bandwidth in the 77 GHz to 81 GHz frequency range, hereinafter
    referred to as the 79 GHz range, intended for Road Transport and Traffic Telematics
    (RTTT) applications. Applications include e.g. Short Range Radar (SRR) for obstacle
    detection, stop&go, blind spot detection, parking aid, backup aid, precrash and
    other automotive applications. \r\n"
