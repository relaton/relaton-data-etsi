abstract:
- content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) describes the\r\nrequirements
    for the management of performance measurements and the\r\ncollection of performance
    measurement data across a Public Land Mobile\r\nNetwork (PLMN). It defines the
    administration of measurement\r\nschedules, the generation of measurement results
    in the Network\r\nElements (NEs) and the transfer of these results to the Operations\r\nSystem
    (OS). It also describes how the various requirements can be\r\nmodelled as part
    of the generic PLMN information model.\r\nA set of measurements available for
    collection by NEs are described in\r\nannex B, effort has been made to ensure
    consistency in the definition\r\nof measurements between different NEs.\r\nThe
    following is beyond the scope ETS, and therefore this ETS does not\r\ndescribe:\r\n-
    how the data, once accumulated and collected, could or should be\r\nprocessed,
    stored, or presented to an end user;\r\n - the information which may be obtained
    through the collection and\r\nprocessing of call or event related records which
    have been produced\r\nby the NEs primarily for the purpose of raising bills and
    other\r\ncharges.\r\n The management requirements have been derived from existing\r\ntelecommunications
    operations experience. The management definitions\r\nwere then derived from other
    standardisation work so as to minimise\r\nthe re-invention factor. References
    are given as appropriate.\r\nThe objectives of this standardisation are: to normalise
    the\r\ndescription of each measurement; and to produce a common description\r\nof
    the management technique for result accumulation and transmission\r\nacross a
    management interface. The normalisation is intended to result\r\nin comparability
    of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor PLMN.\r\nAs far as possible, existing
    standardisation in the area of\r\nperformanre management has been re-used and
    enhanced where particular\r\nrequirements, peculiar to the mobile telephony environment,
    have been\r\nrecognised.\r\nField of application\r\nThis ETS considers all aspects
    of performance management for a PLMN\r\nand its NEs defined in the GSM core Technical
    Specifications. However,\r\nonly those aspects which are GSM specific and particular
    to PLMN\r\noperation are included in this ETS. Other performance measurement\r\naspects
    of described NEs and performance measurement aspects of NEs\r\nnot described by
    the GSM core Technical Specifications are included\r\nfor information purposes
    in annex E or may be found in referenced\r\ndocuments.\r\n "
