    broadcast) over a home network to and between DVB devices in a single home. This
    means that DVB broadcast and broadband networks will be terminated at specific
    DVB Home Network devices connected to the home network that subsequently advertise
    and transport DVB content over the home network to other DVB Home Network devices.
