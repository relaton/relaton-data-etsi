abstract:
- content: "The scope of the present document is to provide guidelines for consolidating
    the SAREF ontology with new reference ontology patterns, using the experience
    of the EUREKA ITEA 12004 SEAS (Smart Energy Aware Systems) project, and to use
    cases for Smart Energy, Smart Building, and Industry of the Future/Industry 4.0
    verticals. \r\nThe present document is applicable to multiple engineering-related
    verticals such as in particular Smart Grids, Micro Grids, Smart Home, Smart Building,
    Electric Mobility, Industry of the Future/Industry 4.0, including all their field
    devices/processes/systems, measurements, environment, actors/players and their
    relations, as well as flexibility/trading/business related aspects.\r\nThese guidelines
    will result in a new set of requirements to update SAREF and its extensions."
