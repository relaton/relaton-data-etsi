abstract:
- content: "Since introduction of new access technologies 5G NR (New Radio), LAA (License
    Assisted Access) and NB-IoT (Narrow Band - Internet of Things), EMC requirements
    for AAS (Active Antenna System) and massive MIMO wireless BS equipment with integral
    antenna array need to be updated. The topics under development include: Emission
    and immunity prospective for all EMC phenomena like operating condition, test
    procedures, performance assessment and performance criteria. Antenna port requirements
    shall be clarified. Aligning with 3GPP TS 37.114 and TS 38.113.\r\nReview and
    potential revision of emission and immunity requirements and corresponding test
    procedures to bring them in line with the latest technology development.\r\nAlignment
    of clauses of EN 301 489-50 with the clauses of EN 301 489-1 v2.2.1 (main normative
    references)\r\nInclude Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) as an alternative performance
    criterion."
