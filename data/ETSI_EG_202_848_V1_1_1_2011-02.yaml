  content: "To develop a technology roadmap for the next ten years with a focus on
    the positive (and possibly negative) impacts of these technologies for older persons
    and persons with disabilities and with the aim of identifying the standardisation
    activities required to address these developments. This work will lead to a contribution
    to \"the inclusion of Design for all approaches including also accessiblity when
    developing mainsteam products and services and the standardisation of interoperable
    solutions between assistive and mainstream technologies\" (2007 ICT Standardisation
    Work Programme). \r\nThe technologies to cover include all those related to both
    the functionality of the product or service as well as to the user interface used
    for providing it. In particular, the following technologies will be of relevance:
    UI concepts (including UI styles and methods and text input, e.g. handwriting
    recognition), acoustics and audio (including speech and audio coding, sound enhancements
    and audio tools), speech (voice for text and command input), and UI hardware (including
    display technologies, cameras, sensors, acoustic components). All these technologies
    will be assessed along a time perspective of ten years for their potential for
    and impact on mainstream products and services used also by older and/or handicapped
    people and on interoperability with assistive technology. Secondly, concrete guidelines
    will be developed for product and service design, and, where appropriate, required
    standardisation."
