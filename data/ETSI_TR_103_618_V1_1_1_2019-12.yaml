  content: 'To present a technical proposal for a quantum-safe hierarchical identity-based
    encryption scheme.  The work item is intended to give an overview of the functionality
    provided by hierarchical identity-based encryption, outline some example use cases,
    and provide a high-level description of a potential lattice-based solution for
    review and feedback.  The work item is also intended to include a discussion of
    the security and efficiency expectations for the solution, along with any implementation
    considerations. '
