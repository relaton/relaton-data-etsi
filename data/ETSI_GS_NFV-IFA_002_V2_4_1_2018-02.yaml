abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 002 conducts NFV Release 2 maintenance: it corrects
    errors, ambiguities, misalignments, and applies editorial modifications (i.e.
    Corrections of category F and D as described in ETSI TWPs Annex L). This edition
    does not add or modify features, nor does it extend the scope of the former Release
    2 edition summarized hereafter:\r\nIFA 002 specifies requirements for a set of
    abstract interfaces enabling a VNF to leverage acceleration\r\nservices from the
    infrastructure, regardless of their implementation. IFA 002 also provides an acceleration
    architectural model to support its deployment model."
