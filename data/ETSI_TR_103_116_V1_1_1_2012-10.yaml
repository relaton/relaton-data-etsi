  content: "To verify the current energy efficiency measurement method ETSI TS 102
    706 V1.2.1. and to gain practical results and potential need for clarification.
    \r\n\r\nFurther to identify the benefit of additional enhancement like fast fading,
    interference/noise, mobility etc. and also other factors like temperature dependence
    into the measurement method. \r\n\r\nThe future energy efficiency method shall
    promote additional power saving features. "
