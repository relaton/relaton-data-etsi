  content: 'Scope of work to be undertaken: This feasibility study will define possible
    requirements for and formulate an overall and harmonized technical concept of
    the Cognitive Radio System.. Both infrastructure as well as infrastructure-less
    radio networks will be covered. Based on such system concept and requirements  the
    identification of candidate topics for standardization at ETSI  is the key target
    of this study including also a survey of related activities in other SDOs .'
