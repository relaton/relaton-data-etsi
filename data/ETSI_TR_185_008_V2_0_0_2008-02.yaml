  content: The objective of this WI is to analyse the security mechanisms that could
    be supported in the customer environment (Customer Network Gateway or Customer
    Devices) with reference to  the overall end to end security architecture for the
    NGN defined by WG7. As examples, these mechanisms can be related to authentication
    (for connectivity and for services), firewalling and network access/parental control,
    virus protection, intrusion detection, Anti Spam capabilities. The activity will
    be performed in close relationship with WG7
