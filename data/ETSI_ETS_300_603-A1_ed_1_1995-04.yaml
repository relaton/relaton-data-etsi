  content: "REASON 1:\r\nMany existing PH support only X.31 case B. For these PHs
    the case A/B\r\nconversion in the GSM HPLMN is necessary.\r\nCONSEQUENCES OF NON-ACCEPTANCE
    1:\r\nThis amendment is necessary to allow basic packet access to PH\r\nsupporting
    only case B. For these PH exists agreement between the\r\nPLMN and the fixed network
    operators to signal the case B between PLMN\r\nand ISDN. If the amendment is not
    accepted then the interworking could\r\nbe faulty and a large number of PHs could
    not work efficiently.\r\n REASON 2:\r\nIn the case of more than one subscribed
    basic packet moded service, it\r\nis necessary to select one of the corresponding
    user rates as the PH\r\ndoes not send an applicable user rate.\r\n CONSEQUENCES
    OF NON-ACCEPTANCE 2:\r\nThe correct access of basic packet mode in case of more
    than one\r\nsubscribed basic packet service is not guaranteed.\r\n  "
