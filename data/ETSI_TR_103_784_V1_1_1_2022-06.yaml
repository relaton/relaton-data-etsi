abstract:
- content: This new TR will be optimised for the specific requirements of the marine
    environment, using 9 digit MMSI for signalling and taking into account many of
    the features of the terrestrial dPMR standard TS 102 658. Intended usage is to
    support the replacement / co-existence with existing VHF voice channels in the
    156-163 MHz marine band.
