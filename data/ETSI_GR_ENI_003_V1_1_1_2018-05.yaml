abstract:
- content: A critical foundation of experiential networked intelligence is context-
    and situation-awareness. This WI will analyse work done in various SDOs on network
    policy management in general, and context-aware network policy management specifically,
    to determine what can be reused and what needs to be developed. The requirements
    documented in this report will be considered during the architecture design work
