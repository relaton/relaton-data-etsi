- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "ANF-CIDL is an additional network feature which allows the identification
    \ and correlation of calls throughout a PISN by assigning unambiguous identifiers
    \ to each new call  and also,  as an option,  to transformed and logically linked
    calls.\r\nThis ANF has been developed to support the use of CSTA (ECMA-269) in
    a networked environment, i.e. in a PISN. Use of this ANF for other applications
    is not precluded."
