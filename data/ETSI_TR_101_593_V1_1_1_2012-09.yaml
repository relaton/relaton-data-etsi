  content: Analyse the various classes of GNSS receiver (as defined in rec. ITU-R
    M1477_NEW see document 4/98 from ITU-R SG4) versus the potential addressed market.
    Identify the expected range of performances for each class of receiver taking
    into account typical design and implementation information. Analyse the susceptibility
    of each class of receivers towards several types of interferences potentially
    encountered. Conclude with recommendation for one or more associated Technical
    Specifications.
