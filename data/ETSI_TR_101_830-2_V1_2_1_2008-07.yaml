abstract:
- content: "The present document gives guidance on a common methodology for studying
    the impact of noise on xDSL performance (maximum reach, noise margin, maximum
    bitrate) when changing parameters within various Spectral Management scenarios.
    These methods enable reproducible results and a consistent presentation of the
    assumed conditions (characteristics of cables and xDSL equipment) and configuration
    (chosen technology mixture and cable fill) of each scenario.\r\nThe revision could
    add to this:\r\n(a) receiver performance models for all variants of VDSL, ADSL2plus,
    enhanced-SDSL and ADSL2.\r\n(b) transmitter models for the same modems (PSD templates
    in stead of PSD masks, PSD shaping parameters\r\n(c) models for crosstalk from
    multiple locations, such as topologies with customers distributed along the line
    (relevant for VDSL simulations) or branched topologies.\r\n(d) additional example
    scenarios\r\n(e) refining the generic DMT model by accounting for side-lobe pick-up\r\n(f)
    etc."
