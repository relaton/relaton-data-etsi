  content: "W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) is an open standard for digital credentials.
    A verifiable credential is a tamper-evident credential with authorship that can
    be cryptographically verified. \r\n\r\nThe W3C standard intentionally does not
    specify a single verification (proof) method, but expects several methods to mature
    independently and become standardized in time. To guarantee interoperability,
    W3C maintains a registry of proof mechanisms (including several experimental ones)
    known as Verifiable Credentials Extension Registry.\r\n\r\nThis work item will
    define a new proof method via a challenge-response authentication protocol based
    on Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE). In this proof method,
    CP-ABE keys encode attributes, while the expressiveness of CP-ABE policies enables
    their selective disclosure and/or proof of predicates over them. Relationship
    with existing Zero Knowledge Proof methods will be highlighted.\r\n"
