abstract:
- content: "W3C “Verifiable Credentials” (VCs) is an open standard for digital credentials.
    A verifiable credential is a tamper-evident credential with authorship that can
    be cryptographically verified. \r\n\r\nThe W3C standard intentionally does not
    specify a single verification (“proof”) method, but expects several methods to
    mature independently and become standardized in time. To guarantee interoperability,
    W3C maintains a registry of proof mechanisms (including several “experimental”
    ones) known as Verifiable Credentials Extension Registry.\r\n\r\nThis work item
    will define a new proof method via a challenge-response authentication protocol
    based on Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE). In this proof
    method, CP-ABE keys encode attributes, while the expressiveness of CP-ABE policies
    enables their selective disclosure and/or proof of predicates over them. Relationship
    with existing “Zero Knowledge Proof” methods will be highlighted.\r\n"
