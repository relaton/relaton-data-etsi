abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies specifies XAdES digital signatures. XAdES
    signatures are built on XML digital signatures, by incorporation of signed and
    unsigned qualifying properties, which fulfil certain common requirements (such
    as the long term validity of digital signatures, for instance) in a number of
    use cases.\r\nThe present document specifies a number of XAdES signature levels,
    each one based on different combinations of qualifying properties, with a higher
    degree of optionality than the XAdES baseline signatures specified.\r\nThe present
    document aims at supporting electronic signatures in different regulatory frameworks.\r\n"
