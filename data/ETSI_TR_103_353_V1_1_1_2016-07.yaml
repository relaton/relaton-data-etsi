abstract:
- content: 'Full life cycle assessment (LCA) for a satellite broadband network. This
    version only covers GHG emissions and does not cover other environmental impacts
    such as water quality or ozone depletion. Also does not cover environmental impact
    of scarce resources such as spectrum utilisation or orbital positions. References:
