  content: "Stage 3 specification of Integrated IPTV subsystem to support IPTV services
    based on the architecture and Stage 2 information flows described in WI2074 (TS
    182 028).\r\nThis specification will describe the Procedures for the Functional
    Entities and Call Flows for applicable protocols and enhancements for existing
    protocols if required. \r\nInteractions with other subsystems, new services added
    in NGN Release 3 and common areas between dedicated and IMS based subsystems will
    be further considered. \r\nApplicability of existing IPTV protocols and ongoing
    work in other SDOs will be considered."
