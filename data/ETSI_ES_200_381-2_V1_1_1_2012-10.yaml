  content: Part 2 of this multipart ETSI Standard defines the requirements for cellular
    speech terminals providing inductive coupling with hearing aids. As the general
    measurement principles are described in part 1 of the ES, part 2 describes additional
    (or alternative) measurement methods dedicated to cellular speech terminals. The
    plan is to leverage North American standards such as ANSI and TIA as much as possible.
