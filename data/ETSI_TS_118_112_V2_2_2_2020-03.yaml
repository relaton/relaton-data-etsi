  content: "This work item provides a plan what needs to be done to enhance the oneM2M
    System to interwork with - not oneM2M based - Area Networks and their devices
    (subsequently called 'interworked systems')\r\nThe target of this WI is a 'generic'
    way how such interworking can be accomplished for any kind of interworked system
    with small additional standardization/specification effort in oneM2M and for any
    specific interworked system. \r\nIt also strives for minimal need of administrative
    configuration and for plug-and-play (minimal manual customization need) as far
    as possible.\r\nGeneric Interworking could be utilized for Device Abstraction.
    \r\nThe WI is based on Rel-1 work contained in TR-0007 by utilizing semantic description
    of the interworked system."
