  content: Alert messages need to be presented to users affected by possible alerts
    in a way that they can be readily understood and required actions can be taken.
    It is obvious that the presentation of these alert messages needs to be fully
    accessible for the largest possible user community, including people with specific
    requirements and elderly people with multiple impairments. The proposed Technical
    Report will summarize guidelines and good practice proposals to the design process
    of the user interface for the presentation of alert message on a wide range of
    end user devices in a fully accessible manner. SC EMTEL and TC HF will work in
    close cooperation to produce this TR.
