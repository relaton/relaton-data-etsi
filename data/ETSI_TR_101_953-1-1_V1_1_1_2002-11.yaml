abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this work item is to produce a multi-part ETSI Technical
    Report (TR)  containing test specifications for DSL splitters. The main objectives
    in mind are: \r\n§to correlate the splitter parameters with respect to the performance
    objectives of the DSL, POTS and ISDN services, to assist the on going standardisation
    process (production of the  Multi-Part European Standard : “European Specific
    DSL Splitter Requirements” (ES-Splitters)).\r\n§to specify unified and generic
    testing methods for all splitters based on the requirements specified in the TR
    101 728, TS 101 388 and TS 101 270 taking into account additional ITU-T DSL Recommendations
    and possible other relevant Standards as from Cenelec.\r\n§to validate the testing
    methods used to perform practical measurement in implementing executable test
    suites on existing test platforms (in accredited labs)\r\n§to provide as an input
    to TM6 and TC-AT the related test specifications possibly intended to be included
    within the ES-Splitter.\r\n§To liaise with possible Bake-Off events to be organized
    by the ETSI Bake-Off support team. The objective being to confirm splitter parameters
    with respect to services (POTS, ISDN, DSL) performance objectives or to evaluate
    the performance degradation when inserting splitters in local loops.\r\nTC-AT
    will co-operate with TM6 as agreed during the last TM6#22 meeting, to complement
    their activity on splitter testing methods in covering the Low-pass section of
    the ADSL/POTS and VDSL/POTS splitters. Other items as distributed lowpass filters
    may be added if requested.\r\nThe following items are included within the scope
    of the concurrent TM6 work item: HPF and DC Block of the ADSL/POTS, ADSL/ISDN-BA,
    HPF and DC Block of the VDSL/POTS, VDSL/ISDN-BA. Other splitter types may be added
    if requested. \r\nPart 1.1 is the Specification of Testing methods for Low Pass
    part of ADSL/POTS splitters."
