abstract:
- content: "In response to the R&TTE-CA query (document ERM_39_40_39 <http://docbox.etsi.org/erm/erm/meeting39_40/ERM_39_40_39_LS_RTTECA_to_ERM_re_EN_300_440-1_detector.zip>),
    EN 300 440-2 will be slightly revised in order to clarify which is the appropriate
    detector to be used for measuring spurious emissions. The following parameters
    will also be modified: \r\n·for carrier frequencies above 20 GHz, in measurements
    of unwanted emissions in the spurious domain and spurious emissions, the upper
    frequency of the measurements will be consistent with the market actual commonly
    available measuring receiver \r\n·the upper limit of the calibration of the shielded
    RF anechoic chamber will be brought in line with the above bullet point's upper
    frequency measurement.\r\nAmendments to bring Part 2  in line with Part 1 will
    be done as relevant.\r\n"
