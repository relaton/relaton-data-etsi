abstract:
- content: The objective of this WI is to specify the main security mechanisms to
    be implemented in the customer premises network (either in the Customer Network
    Gateway or in the Customer Network Devices) to support the overall end to end
    security architecture for the NGN release 3. This WI will adopt as a starting
    point the contents of the TR185 008 â€œ Analysis of security mechanisms for customer
    networks connected to TISPAN NGN R2  and will define the security mechanisms taking
    into acccount the implementation recommendations contained in that TR. The activity
    will be performed in close relationship with WG7.?????
