  content: Detailed mapping tables are provided to show which security requirement
    and provision from the IEC 62443-4-2 and the ETSI EN 303 645, respectively, covers
    which specific requirement from the standardization request for the RED articles
    3(3)(d), 3(3)(e) and 3(3)(f). Hence, every single provision and requirement of
    both standards - IEC 62443-4-2 and EN 303 645 - is mapped to every single specific
    requirement written in the standardisation request for the RED articles 3(3)(d),
    (e) and (f).
