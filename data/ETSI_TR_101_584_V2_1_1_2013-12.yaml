  content: "This study is motivated by the fact that within the ETSI M2M System semantic
    information needs to be available on M2M data that are transferred within the
    M2M system. Through such semantic information M2M data can be discovered by applications
    that do not have prior knowledge on them. The capability of the ETSI M2M System
    to enable applications to discover, interpret and use M2M data from different
    sources is considered essential for creating high-level M2M services and to develop
    open markets for M2M data. \r\n In this study pre-normative work will be conducted
    in order to facilitate normative specification work in ETSI M2M Rel.-2 or later.
    \r\n  The study will analyse benefit, feasibility and potential requirements for
    the support of semantic information on application related M2M Resources in the
    M2M system. The ETSI M2M system would, however, only provide a means to create
    and handle such semantic information in the ETSI M2M system; ETSI M2M shall continue
    to stay independent of vertical markets who in general would define the semantics
    of M2M data related to their field of expertise.   \r\n The study will create
    use cases that illustrate provisioning and usage of such semantic information
    and that demonstrate the benefit for the M2M ecosystem.  \r\n It will investigate
    on the kind and amount of semantic information that would become available in
    the M2M system, keeping in mind a trade-off between complexity and usability.
    \r\n It will investigate discovery mechanisms for semantic information in the
    ETSI M2M System. This should take into account how existing solutions from other
    standards or research could be used within the ETSI M2M architecture.\r\n It will
    consider on issues of ownership/responsibility for application related M2M Resources
    in the case that the M2M system can provide semantic information on them. This
    needs to take into account the need for support of different levels of data privacy
    and confidentiality. \r\nThis work item will relate to WI 0014 (TR 102 966 - Interworking
    between the M2M Architecture and M2M Area Network technologies), as a further
    step in the abstraction of LAN technologies and devices . \r\nExisting relevant
    standards need to be taken into account. It is also expected that the study can
    benefit from inputs of related research projects."
