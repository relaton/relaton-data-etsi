abstract:
- content: "This revision of NFV-IFA 004 conducts NFV Release 2 maintenance: it corrects
    errors, ambiguities, misalignments, and applies editorial modifications (i.e.
    Corrections of category F and D as described in ETSI TWPs Annex L). This edition
    does not add or modify features, nor does it extend the scope of the former Release
    2 edition summarized hereafter:\r\n\r\nIFA 004 specifies functional requirements
    for both the Virtualised Infrastructure Manager (VIM) and the NFV Infrastructure
    (NFVI), for NFV acceleration from an infrastructure management perspective. This
    includes the controlling and management of acceleration resources, e.g. allocation,
    release and discovery of acceleration resources. IFA 004 also identifies the corresponding
    impacts on VIM related specifications regarding functional requirements ETSI GS
    NFV-IFA 010 and reference points (ETSI GS NFV-IFA 005 and ETSI GS NFV-IFA 006)."
