  content: This work item focuses on the security assurance of NFV-MANO products.
    The outcome of this WI expects the security assets, security requirements and
    test cases for evaluating the security NFV-MANO products. In this work item, the
    security assurance methodology introduced in 3GPP specifications will be leveraged.
    Using the security requirements defined in release 4 SEC specs (i.e., NFV SEC014,
    NFV SEC024, NFV SEC025.) as inputs, security test cases including testing goals,
    testing steps, and evidence of testing results will be produced for evaluating
    whether the security requirements are implemented by NFV-MANO based products.
    Such products can incorporate only some of the NFV-MANO components.
