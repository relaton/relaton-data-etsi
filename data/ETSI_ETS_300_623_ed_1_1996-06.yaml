  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) addresses the network\r\nmanagement
    messages and procedures across the A-bis interface, which\r\nis defined as Qx
    in GSM. The information model included here defines\r\nthe objects and how they
    are addressed for purposes of operations and\r\nmaintenance activities.\r\nThere
    is a requirement for the A-bis interface to be open to allow\r\ninteroperation
    between BTSs of different manufacturers working to the\r\nsame BSC. This ETS addresses
    this requirement from O&M point of view,\r\nwhich allows this interworking to
    take place. It shows the split of NM\r\nfunctions between BSC and BTS. The procedures
    and coding of the\r\nmessages are specified in detail. In practice, in addition
    to this ETS\r\nit is necessary that the content of manufacturer-dependent information\r\nfields
    be specified to fulfill the functionality.\r\nIt is essential for operation that
    a BSC can handle the functions used\r\nby all its BTSs. Therefore, all items in
    this ETS are considered\r\nmandatory unless otherwise indicated in this ETS.\r\n
