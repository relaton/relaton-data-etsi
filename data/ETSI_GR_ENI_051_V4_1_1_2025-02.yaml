  content: "The present document analyses and studies potential ENI activities on
    6G native AI capabilities. ENI has a strong focus on providing cognitive capabilities
    to improve the user experience of the operator. The present document covers the
    areas and needs for new technical projects using 6G native AI capabilities. This
    covers: definition of the use cases and requirements of Core Network (CN) Large
    Language Models (LLMs), definition of the CN-Agent to facilitate interaction between
    the CN and the CN LLMs, identification of the key functional modules and interfaces
    of the CN-Agent, and the key technologies required. Network slicing is used throughout
    the present document to explain the operation of this system. However, this is
    not a limiting case, and the system described in the present document is intended
    to serve a large variety of CN use cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
