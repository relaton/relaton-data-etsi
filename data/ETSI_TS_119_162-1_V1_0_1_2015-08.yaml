abstract:
- content: "The present document specifies Associated Signature Containers which bind
    together into one single digital container based on ZIP either detached digital
    signatures, time-assertions, with a number of data objects (e.g. documents, XML
    structured data, spreadsheet, multimedia content) to which they apply.\r\nThe
    present document specifies the ASiC building blocks and a baseline profile.\r\nThe
    ASiC baseline profile supports the following signature, time assertion formats:\r\n•\tCAdES
    baseline signatures;\r\n•\tXAdES baseline signatures;\r\n•\tRFC 3161 time-stamp
    tokens; and \r\n•\tRFC 4998 or RFC 6283 evidence records.\r\nNOTE:\tNo restriction
    is placed on time assertions eventually used within CAdES/XAdES.\r\nNew elements
    are defined in the present document to support additional features such as time-stamping
    and CAdES signing of multiple content and XAdES parallel signatures that can be
    used in other contexts.\r\nThe present document does not address the identification
    of the validation policy to be used for verifying a container that contains time-stamp
    assertions.\r\n"
