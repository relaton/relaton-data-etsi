  content: "This European Telecommunication Standard (ETS) gives the detailed requ\r\nirements
    for the correct operation of the background acoustic noise ev\r\naluation, noise
    parameter encoding/decoding and comfort noise generati\r\non in GSM Mobile Stations
    (MS)s and Base Station Systems (BSS)s during\r\nDiscontinuous Transmission (DTX)
    on half rate speech traffic channels\r\n.\r\nThe requirements described in this
    ETS are mandatory for implementatio\r\nn in all GSM MSs capable of supporting
    the half rate speech traffic ch\r\nannel.\r\nThe receiver requirements are mandatory
    for implementation in all GSM\r\nBSSs capable of supporting the half rate speech
    traffic channel, the t\r\nransmitter requirements are only for those where downlink
    DTX will be\r\nused.\r\n The requirements described in this ETS are mandatory
