  content: "This work item will study the potential requirements and enhancements
    needed to support MEC deployment in park enterprises scenario. The study will
    focus on these aspects: 1) How 3GPP and MEC system cooperate to enable DN-AAA
    authentication and authorization for UEs to access MEC system based on location
    (e.g. based ULCL insertion); 2) Potential MEC service which provides AAA functionality
    to enterprise user,  at MEC system level or MEC host level; 3) Relationship with
    MEC014 UE Identity API, and other possible enhancements in addition to those in
    MEC014. The study will consider the development of other standards/industry bodies
    such as 3GPP and all related work done in ETSI. The outcome is to generate recommendations
    for future standard work, e.g., enhancements to current MEC system, possible new
    service APIs, interface enhancements, etc.\r\n"
