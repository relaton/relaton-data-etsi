  content: "This document identifies trends in the design of networks and choices
    of technology that affect speech transmission quality and are expected to lead
    to a wider range of quality levels that will be experienced by callers. The document
    reviews the implications of the ITU definitions of call quality categories and
    identifies the main impairment factors that need to be managed in order to provide
    specified levels of quality. The document explores the options for exchanging
    information between interconnected networks and concludes by specifying a \"Stage1\"
    type of description for the exchange of quality parameter information about individual
    calls.\r\n"
