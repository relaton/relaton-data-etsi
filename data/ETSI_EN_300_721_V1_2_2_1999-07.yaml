abstract:
- content: "This Harmonised Standard will specify the technical requirements that
    apply to Mobile Earth Stations (MESs) for compliance with Article 17 of Council
    Directive 98/13/EC.\r\nThere are no essential requirements under Article 17.6
    of Directive 98/13/EC for terminals approved against this Harmonised Standard,
    and there is no guarantee of correct interworking between satellite earth station
    equipment.\r\nThe Mobile Earth Stations (MESs) have the following characteristics:\r\nThe
    MESs will operate in frequency ranges below 1 GHz, which are expected to be allocated
    to Mobile Satellite Data Services operating in bands below 1 GHz, the use of which
    is expected to be harmonised through implementation of ERC Decisions accordance
    with the ITU Radio Regulations to the Mobile Satellite Services;\r\nThe MESs could
    be either a based MES (BMES), a vehicle mounted MES (VMES) or a portable MES (PMES);\r\nThe
    MESs operate through satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) as part of a network
    providing low bit rate data communications;\r\nThe MESs are controlled and monitored
    by a Network Control Facility (NCF). The NCF is outside the scope of this Harmonised
    Standard.\r\nThe requirements of this Harmonised Standard shall be selected to
    ensure an adequate level of compatibility with other radio services.\r\nThis Harmonised
    Standard does not contain any requirement, recommendation or information about
    the installation of the MESs\r\nCompliance of a MES to the requirements of this
    Harmonised Standard does not imply that the MES may be used. In conformity with
    Article 15.2 of Directive 98/13/EC, the use of such equipment may be subject to
    licensing terms in conformity with Community law.\r\n"
