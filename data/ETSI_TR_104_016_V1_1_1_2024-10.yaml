abstract:
- content: This proposed work item will describe a repeatable divide and conquer-style
    framework for migrating, in a prioritized order, an enterpriseâ€™s information security
    assets from quantum-vulnerable states to quantum-safe states. First, the approach
    will give recommendations for partitioning the enterprise into discrete elements.
    Following, through various analyses within and between the elements of the partition,
    a methodology will be described for establishing quantum-safe migration plans
    for each partition element.
