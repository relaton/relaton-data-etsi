abstract:
- content: "The oneM2M Base Ontology should be enhanced by:\r\n路Bug fixing and completing
    the release 2 specification where needed.\r\n路Extending the current model of Service/Operation
    vs. Functionality/Command to be used for Abstraction of machine-type Operations
    into abstracted Commands. The oneM2M Base Ontology needs to be able to support
    indication of the rules used for abstraction.\r\nThe basic mode of operation of
    the IPE should be enhanced by:\r\n路Bug fixing and completing the release 2 specification
    where needed.\r\n路Enhancements to the specified communication scheme with the
    Ontology based IWK IPE, e.g.:\r\noUse of <flexContainer>s as content sharing resources\r\noAligning
    Ontology based Interworking with the principles of TS-0033.\r\noMoving content
    on Ontology based Interworking from TS-0012 into a separate TS (TS-0030).  \r\n"
