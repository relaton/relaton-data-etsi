abstract:
- content: "As NFV evolves toward a cloud-native architecture, GitOps can be used
    for managing the increasing complexity of Telco Clouds. For example, GitOps can
    support the automated deployment, scaling, updating, and termination of Telco
    Cloud Applications and resources through file updates and actions taken by GitOps
    controllers. This proposal investigates the use of GitOps paradigm in the management
    of Telco Cloud and provides recommendations for normative work if necessary.\r\nThe
    scope of the former edition (v6.1.1) is summarized hereafter: \r\nThe present
    document studies and describes the architectural changes related to the NFV architectural
    framework, to support new trends in NFV-based Telco Cloud evolution, such as new
    types of virtualisation technologies, heterogenous infrastructure or hyper-distributed
    edge deployment, computing and network convergence.\r\nStarting with a study on
    future trends related to NFV-based Telco Cloud evolution and their respective
    architectural targets applied to the NFV architectural framework, key architectural
    principles are identified for deriving potential architectural changes to the
    current NFV architectural framework. Resolutions to fulfil the architectural targets
    of future trends by the proposed NFV architectural changes are also analysed.
    At the end, recommendations for the normative work of architectural framework
    for Telco Cloud are delivered considering the future trends.\r\n"
