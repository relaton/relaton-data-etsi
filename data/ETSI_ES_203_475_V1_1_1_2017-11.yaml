abstract:
- content: "The aim is develop a framework standard that will take into consideration
    all general aspects, terms and main trends towards energy efficiency/management,
    including but not limited to:\r\n•\tNew Standards dealing with this scope (e.g.
    future Standard under development or planned, \r\n•\tExisting ETSI standard on
    energy efficiency, monitoring and KPis,\r\n•\tExisting ITU-T Recommendations:
    ITU-T L.1310, L.1340 ……\r\n•\tOther SDO’s deliverable .\r\nThe general part of
    the framework will provide general requirements such as definitions of common
    understanding of terms, clarification of energy efficiency definition for different
    types of technologies (e.g. equipment/site/network/service level)…\r\nPart of
    the activity will cover test instrumentation specification"
