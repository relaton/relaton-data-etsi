  content: "The aim is develop a framework standard that will take into consideration
    all general aspects, terms and main trends towards energy efficiency/management,
    including but not limited to:\r\n\tNew Standards dealing with this scope (e.g.
    future Standard under development or planned, \r\n\tExisting ETSI standard on
    energy efficiency, monitoring and KPis,\r\n\tExisting ITU-T Recommendations: ITU-T
    L.1310, L.1340 \r\n\tOther SDOs deliverable .\r\nThe general part of the framework
    will provide general requirements such as definitions of common understanding
    of terms, clarification of energy efficiency definition for different types of
    technologies (e.g. equipment/site/network/service level)\r\nPart of the activity
    will cover test instrumentation specification"
