  content: "This work item will specify extensions and new capabilities to support
    and integrate digital twin technologies with the ZSM framework reference architecture
    \  in order to improve end to end zero-touch network and service management and
    automation. \r\nThe work will define use cases related to Network Digital Twin
    (NDT) to derive specific requirements. The work will also document ZSM NDT principles
    and zero touch management of the NDT operation.  \r\nThe deliverable will be a
    stage 1 and 2 normative document based on the reference architecture and will
    refer to available standards and open source works where appropriate. The content
    of the ETSI GR ZSM 015 will be used as inputs to this work item."
