  content: To describe technical interference mitigation measures to protect RAS against
    interference from ground based vehicular radars (as potential alternatives to
    protection zones). The TR is based on the existing studies in ECC report 350 and
    is focused on the open question (see LS in ERM(24)083040) on usability of protection
    zones raised by the industry during ECC discussions (FM and SRD/MG) on the public
    consultation comments for revision of ECC/DEC/(04)03.
