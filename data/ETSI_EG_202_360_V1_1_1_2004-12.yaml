  content: "This ETSI Guide specifies the possible scenarios and characteristics of
    different SIGTRAN adaptation layers (xUA, xPA). Recommendations are given according
    to the applicability of  SIGTRAN adaptation protocols for carrying SS7 in different
    network scenarios.\r\nIt has to be analysed and documented which protocol should
    be used in particular situations\r\nIt has to be analysed and documented how the
    protocols should be used and are inter-working with the SS7 network. For example,
    it has to be considered what happens in single Signalling Gateway (SG) and dual
    SG scenarios.\r\n\r\n"
