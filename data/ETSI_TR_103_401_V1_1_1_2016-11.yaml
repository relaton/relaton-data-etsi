abstract:
- content: "1) systems suitable for Smart Grids, e.g. to include at least the following
    essential criteria:  very high link availability; >30km link lengths; priority
    access,  stringent end-to-end latency requirements; coverage to remote / unpopulated
    areas;  licensed self-managed spectrum in a variety of bands (e.g. 400 MHz [including
    the FIXED / MOBILE sub-bands that have a European Common Allocation for Mobile
    systems and] 1400 / 1500 MHz); ability for Best Practice resilient operation.
    2) the essential requirements for systems suitable for other Utility Operations
    radio systems. 3) the long-term spectrum requirements for Utilities\r\n"
