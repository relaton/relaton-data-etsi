abstract:
- content: "REASON:\r\nThe CLIR interrogation result informs the user only if the
    service is\r\nprovided to her. With the introduction of the second temporary mode,\r\nthis
    information is no longer sufficient. The user can no longer\r\nderive from the
    provisioning of the service whether her number is\r\nshown to the called user
    or not.\r\nCONSEQUENCES OF NON-ACCEPTANCE:\r\nThe user gets only information about
    the provisioning of the service,\r\nbut no information whether the number will
    be shown to the called user\r\nor not.\r\n "
