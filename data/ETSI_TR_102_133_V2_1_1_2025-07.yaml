abstract:
- content: 'The scope of this work item is to update and expand TR 102 133 Access
    to ICT by young people: issues and guidelines. This includes extending the age
    range of the document from under 12 to 18. As at the moment there is inconsistency
    between companies and services how they treat minors. Also, in law, a minor is
    someone under a certain age, usually the age of majority, which demarcates an
    underage individual from legal adulthood. Incorporate relevant legislation and
    regulation which has been introduced sine the TR was originally published. Incorporate
    the design best practices that have emerged since this published and update the
    ones already discussed. Include the research that has been done since original
    publication. Along with updating or replacing the text that is now out of date.'
