    the collection of data to enable the calculation of the following aspects â€¢ \r\n-
    Objective KPI relating to task efficiency (KPITE) based on data_volume and total
    energy consumption (KPIEC); \r\n- Objective KPI relating to the use of renewable
    energy (KPIREN). \r\n The present document supports the requirements of EN 305
