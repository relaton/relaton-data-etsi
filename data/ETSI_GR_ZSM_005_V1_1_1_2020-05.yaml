  content: "This work item will explore different existing means or approaches, to
    achieve automation. It will not address a survey of standardization activities
    and open-source solutions.\r\n\r\nMeans to explore include (while not limited)\r\n-Alternatives
    for classic modelling such as Intent vs. imperative vs. declarative modeling\r\n-Lessons
    learnt from model driven automation of service and policy orchestration, incl.
    closed loop\r\n-Framework for Self-managed VNFs based on Cloud native network
    functions and implications\r\n-Delineate service modeling against machine learning
    inspired closed loop automation modelling\r\n-Autonomous management \r\n\r\nEach
    of these topics should\r\n-Highlight the problems it solves for the zero-touch
    business goal\r\n-discuss potential implications to technical and functional architecture\r\n\r\nDeliverable
    will be informative\r\n"
