abstract:
- content: The present document describes the next generation transmission system
    for digital terrestrial SISO and MISO broadcasting to handheld terminals making
    use of conventional single aerial structures at transmitting and receiving ends
    (SISO) or of multi-aerial structures at the transmitting and single aerial structures
    at the receiving end (MISO). It specifies the entire physical layer part from
    the input streams to the transmitted signal for a basic DVB-NGH SISO or MISO implementation
    - neither including MIMO nor hybrid nor hybrid MIMO structures. This transmission
    system is intended for carrying Transport Streams or generic data streams feeding
    linear and non-linear applications like television, radio and data services. DVB-NGH
    terminals might also process DVB-T2-lite signals.
