  content: "This WI will provide a standardized description of the important characteristics
    of QKD devices and of the required communication channels in the context of QKD
    deployment on a point-to-point link.  \r\nThe goal will be to provide a comprehensive
    set of information with several objectives:\r\n> Facilitate QKD field implementations
    \ \r\n> Formulate the requirements on QKD devices and communication channels in
    the context of QKD deployment \r\n> High-level comparison of heterogeneous QKD
    technologies\r\nThe WI document will tackle the following items:\r\n> Characterization
    of QKD Communication Systems Performance and Footprint\r\n  - Communications interfaces,
    channel allocation\r\n  - Quantum channel parameters (optical parameters, rate)
    \r\n  - Classical channel parameters (optical parameters, rate) \r\n  - Performance
    (security definition, security parameters, key rate, key latency, raw key)\r\n
    \ - Laser safety, size of device, power requirements, rack-ability\r\n> Characterization
    of the QKD-based requirements on the parameters of the transmission link\r\n  -
    Quantum channel requirements:  attenuation vs. wavelength, tolerable dispersion\r\n
    \ - Classical channel : rate requirements, latency requirements, stability requirements\r\n
    \ - Tolerance to external noise sources"
