abstract:
- content: "This WI shall include:\r\n\r\n1. The specification, within the main body
    of the document (clause 5.5.3), of the RenewedDigestV2 implementing the mechanism
    agreed in ESI#68 for referencing the ds:Reference whose digest is recomputed.\r\n\r\n2.
    The inclusion of a new clause \"A.2  Deprecated qualifying properties\" within
    Annex A with the following sub-clauses:\r\n    \"A.2.1 Use of deprecated qualifying
    properties\", which shall include requirements on how deprecated qualifying properties
    shall be managed.\r\n    \"A.2.2 The RenewedDigests qualifying property\", which
    shall include the specification of the RenewedDigests qualifying property as specified
    in ETSI EN 319 132-1v1.1.1\r\n\r\n3 The insertion of a sentence within the clause
    specifying the time-stamp containers making it clear that these containers encapsulate
    instances of TimeStampToken type specified in clause 2.4.2 of IETF RFC 3161. This
    second amendment comes from  comments raised during the last ETSI remote plugtest
    on signatures validation held during December 2019."
