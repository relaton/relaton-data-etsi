abstract:
- content: "To develop a Technical report that describes new mitigation techniques
    to enable spectrum sharing with Road Tolling and Intelligent Transport Systems
    as outlined in the CEPT and ITU-R studies. In addition, the report will study
    the feasibility of RLANs implementing these new mitigation techniques. \r\nThe
    report should at least include an analysis of the following mitigation technique:\r\n(1)
    Enhanced Protocol recognition/Detect and avoid mitigation techniques\r\n"
