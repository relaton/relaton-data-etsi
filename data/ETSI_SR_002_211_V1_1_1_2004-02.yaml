abstract:
- content: This work is done in answer to mandate M/328.  M/238 invites the ESOs to
    analyse the existing list of standards/specifications published in the OJEC at
    the end of 2002 in support of Article 17 of the Framework Directive (2002/21/EC).
    The objective is to propose how and if it should be adapted to encourage the harmonised
    provision of networks and services, to the extent strictly necessary to ensure
    interoperability of services and to improve freedom of choice for users under
    the new regulatory framework for electronic communications services and networks
    and associated facilities and services. The task also requests that ETSI takes
    account of the technology neutral definitions of electronic communications services
    and network that determine the scope of the new regulatory framework.
