  content: "Additional Network Feature Wireless terminal incoming call (ANF-WTMI)
    directs incoming call to a WTMI user within a PISN regardless of the WTMI user's
    geographical location within the PISN, provided the WTMI user's location is known.\r\n\r\nAdditional
    Network Feature Wireless terminal outgoing call (ANF-WTMO) detects an outgoing
    call from a WTMO user and establishes it as a basic call, regardless of the user's
    geographical location within the PISN. It also provides the WTMO user's service
    profile for use by outgoing call control, or alternatively passes the call to
    the WTMO user's home location for processing."
