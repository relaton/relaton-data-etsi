abstract:
- content: "Intent-based management enables simpler and more user-friendly expressions
    of input information, and higher flexibility in automation.\r\nThis study investigates
    the potential use of intents as key enabler for enhancing autonomous network and
    service management within ZSM framework. It provides guidelines on how to use
    intent-driven management interfaces between the ZSM framework consumers and the
    ZSM management domains (MDs), including the end-to-end service management domain
    (E2ES MD). The study will analyse existing domain and technology-specific intent
    models and intent-based interfaces, document how these could be leveraged in the
    ZSM framework, and provides guidelines for generic intent-driven management interfaces
    and capabilities re-usable by MDs. The study also investigates how to handle conflicting
    intents in the ZSM E2ES MD to mitigate issues and optimize coordination between
    ZSM MDs. The study aims to outline recommendations of needed capabilities for
    intent-driven management within the ZSM framework, which may include intent lifecycle
    management, intent inventory, knowledge management related services, etc. The
    study will take the progress from other standards developing organizations related
    to intents and intent-based management into account, and coordinate with corresponding
    standards groups if needed.\r\n"
