abstract:
- content: "TR 21.910 identifies multi-mode User Equipments categories and describes
    the consequences on roaming capabilities and service availability (e.g. handover)
    of such multi-mode UEs while roaming in various regions implemented with various
    network configurations. The latter objective consists of case studies for each
    of the possible scenarios in reference to existing specifications. In these studies
    it has been important to make sure that no duplication of text has been made or
    that inconsistencies have been created between specifications.\r\nThe initial
    version of this TR is limited to UEs implementing release 99 of the various modes
    roaming in regions implementing specifications up to and including release 99
    of the associated specifications (e.g. a rel 99 multi-mode UE in a release 97
    GSM network should be covered).\r\nIn particular, the release 99 of this TR is
    focused on the type of UE that only can camp on one cell and be in active communication
    in only one mode at the same time. When the UE is in active communication in one
    mode it should be able to listen to the other radio access technologies and make
    e.g. measurements reports on this radio access technology and send them to the
    network, but no simultaneous active communication should be possible. This corresponds
    to a type 2 UE, as defined in the report in ch. 4.\r\nThe scope of this TR is
    the type of terminal implemented with at least the following modes:\r\nUTRA FDD
    and/or TDD mode\r\nGSM mode\r\nThe content of the scenarios could be used for
    other combinations of modes in a multi-mode UE. These are not considered in this
    version of this report.\r\nRegarding the GSM mode, it encompasses the capabilities
    offered by the GSM technical specifications, i.e. MSC services, GPRS, EDGE. This
    means that the sub-categories as offered by GSM should be considered e.g. GPRS
    only terminals, circuit switched only terminal, dual capability terminals.\r\nThe
    present report is built on and references specifications/reports being produced
    in 3GPP or within other relevant foras e.g. ETSI SMG.\r\n"
