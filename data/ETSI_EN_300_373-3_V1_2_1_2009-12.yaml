abstract:
- content: "The present document states the minimum requirements for radio transmitters
    and receivers, for use on ships, operating in either the Medium Frequency (MF)
    only or in the Medium and High Frequency (MF/HF) bands allocated in the International
    Telecommunications Union (ITU) Radio Regulations [1], to the Maritime Mobile Service
    (MMS).\r\nThe present document includes the International Maritime Organization
    (IMO) and ITU requirements included in the relevant provisions of the Radio Regulations
    [1], the International Convention for the Safety Of Life At Sea \r\n(SOLAS) [3],
    the IMO Resolutions A.694(17) [5] and A806 (19) [4] and is primarily intended
    to specify equipment suitable for fitting to ships subject to the SOLAS convention
    and complying with the European Marine Equipment Directive [20].\r\nThe present
    document refers to equipment for one or more of the following:\r\n-Single SideBand
    (SSB) modulation for telephony transmission and reception (J3E);\r\n-Frequency
    Shift Keying (FSK) or SSB modulation of a keyed sub-carrier to transmit and receive
    Digital Selective Calling (DSC) signals in accordance with ITU-R Recommendation
    M.493-10 [6].\r\nThe present document also refers to radio equipment, which is
    not integrated with the DSC encoder or decoder, but defines the interfaces with
    such equipment.\r\nNOTE:The requirements for integrated equipment may be found
    in other relevant ETSs.\r\nThe tests in the present document are applicable to
    receivers for operating on all frequencies in the bands 1 605 kHz to 4 000 kHz
    or 1 605 kHz to 27,5 MHz as allocated in the Radio Regulations [1], to the MMS.\r\nOther
    spot frequency receivers should meet all the requirements of the present document
    and other relevant standards as applicable for the frequencies and modes provided.\r\nIf
    the equipment, or parts of it, are designed in such a manner that they can be
    used for other categories of maritime radiocommunication (e.g. Morse telegraphy
    or NBDP (ETS 300 067 [10]), those parts of the equipment should fulfil the relevant
    requirements of the appropriate standards for the service(s) in question e.g.
    ETS 300 067 [10].\r\nThe EMC parameters defined in the clauses of this standard
    covering emission tests and immunity test (see clauses 8 and 9) have been selected
    to ensure an adequate level of compatibility for apparatus in marine environments.\r\nCompliance
    to the EMC requirements of this standard does not signify compliance to any safety
    requirements. However, it is the responsibility of the assessor of the equipment
    to record in their test report any observations regarding the test sample becoming
    dangerous or unsafe as a result of the application of the tests called for herein.\r\nThe
    present document does not address the testing of ancillary equipment on a stand-alone
    basis, i.e. separately from the radio equipment with which it is to be used.\r\n"
