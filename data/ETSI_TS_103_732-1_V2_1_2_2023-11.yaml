  content: "The purpose of this WI is to initiate work on updates to TS 103 732. The
    TS is turned into a multi-part document with the present document being the base
    PP.\r\nThe updates will focus on the following aspects:\r\n- Add multi-user support
    (an optional requirement moved to another part of TS 103 732);\r\n- Enumerate
    cryptographic requirements (e.g. algorithm types, key sizes);\r\n- Iterate requirements
    for clarity;\r\n- include feedback from laboratories and vendors performing current
    evaluations;\r\n- additional reviews of data protection, access control, and permission
    management;\r\n- Changes due to the PP certification process.\r\nAdditional changes
    may be considered as needed to ensure consistency within the document.\r\nNote:
    Biometric Authentication is moved to another part of TS 103 732\r\nThe WI will
    also consider any changes which may be necessary to support a possible GSMA certification
    scheme based on TS 103 732.\r\n"
