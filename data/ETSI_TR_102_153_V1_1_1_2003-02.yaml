  content: "ETSI TC ESI  has remarked that existing certificate profiles, among them
    TS 101 862 [6], are considered too open, allowing too many choices, which lead
    to incompatible implementations. It has then agreed to launch a pre-study to assess
    the preconditions for an action to further profile the certificate formats.\r\nThe
    purpose of this study is to cover, but not be limited to, qualified certificates.\r\nThe
    main finding of this study is that more rigid profiles are deemed necessary to
    actually achieve interoperability and, therefore, to ensure the free movement
    within the internal market and to build trust in electronic signature. \r\nTherefore
    the next step should be to issue a Technical Standard specify the full format
    of a Qualified Certificate both from an issuer point of view and from a verifier
    point of view. Formats for citizen certificates (Electronic Identity Certificates)
    could also be indicated.\r\n"
